    "description": "By means of this spell, the caster is able to show any animal of animal intelligence to semi-intelligence (i.e., Intelligence 1-4) that he desires friendship. If the animal does not roll a successful saving throw vs. spell immediately when the spell is begun, it stands quietly while the caster finishes the spell. Thereafter, it follows the caster about. The spell functions only if the caster actually wishes to be the animal's friend. If the caster has ulterior motives, the animal always senses them (for example, the caster intends to eat the animal, send it ahead to set off traps, etc.). The caster can teach the befriended animal three specific tricks or tasks for each point of Intelligence it possesses. Typical tasks are those taught to a dog or similar pet (i.e., they cannot be complex). Training for each such trick must be done over a period of one week, and all must be done within three months of acquiring the creature. During the three-month period, the animal will not harm the caster, but if the creature is left alone for more than a week, it will revert to its natural state and act accordingly. The caster can use this spell to attract up to 2 Hit Dice of animal(s) per experience level he possesses. This is also the maximum total Hit Dice of the animals that can be attracted and trained at one time: no more than twice the caster's experience level. Only unaligned animals can be attracted, befriended, and trained. The material components of this spell are the caster's holy symbol and a piece of food liked by the animal."

The caster determines at what range (up to 60 yards) he will cast the spell. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot cube centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not). A second use of this spell is to bless a single item (for example, a crossbow bolt for use against a rakshasa). The weight of the item is limited to one pound per caster level and the effect lasts until the item is used or the spell duration ends. Multiple bless spells are not cumulative. In addition to the verbal and somatic gesture components, the bless spell requires holy water. This spell can be reversed by the priest to a curse spell that, when cast upon enemy creatures, lowers their morale and attack rolls by -1. The curse requires the sprinkling of unholy water."

The degree of evil (dim, faint, moderate, strong, or overwhelming) and possibly its general nature (expectant, malignant, gloating, etc.) can be noted. If the evil is overwhelming, the priest has a 10% chance per level of detecting its general bent (lawful, neutral, or chaotic).

The spell is directional--the caster must face the desired direction to determine if a pit exists or a trap is laid in that direction. The caster experiences a feeling of danger from the direction of a detected hazard, which increases as the danger is approached. The caster learns the general nature of the danger (pit, snare, or deadfall) but not its exact operation, nor how to disarm it.

Light can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar substance. The effect is immobile unless it is specifically centered on a movable object or mobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a creature, any applicable magic resistance and saving throws must be rolled. Successful resistance negates the spell, while a successful saving throw indicates that the spell is centered immediately behind the creature, rather than upon the creature itself. A light spell centered on the visual organs of a creature blinds it, reducing its attack and saving throw rolls by 4 and worsening its Armor Class by 4.

Second, any attempt to exercise mental control over the protected creature (if, for example, it has been charmed by a vampire) or to invade and take over its mind (as by a ghost's magic jar attack) is blocked by this spell. Note that the protection does not prevent a vampire's charm itself, nor end it, but it does prevent the vampire from exercising mental control through the barrier. Likewise, an outside life force is merely kept out, and would not be expelled if in place before the protection was cast. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured nature (such as aerial servants, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the natural (body) weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creature to recoil if such attacks require touching the protected creature. Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character. This protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. To complete this spell, the priest uses holy water or burning incense. This spell can be reversed to become protection from good, with the second and third benefits remaining unchanged.

If the recipient has recently (that day) failed a saving throw against such an attack, the spell immediately grants another saving throw, with a +4 bonus to the die roll. For every four levels of the caster, one creature can be affected by the spell (one creature at levels 1 through 4, two creatures at levels 5 through 8, etc.). The reverse of the spell, cause fear, causes one creature to flee in panic at maximum movement speed away from the caster for 1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw against the reversed effect negates it, and any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Of course, cause fear can be automatically countered by remove fear and vice versa. Neither spell has any effect on undead of any sort."

As an incidental benefit, the caster also attunes himself to  the plane much faster and suffers no penalties for missile fire while astral.    While astral celerity is most often used in the astral plane, it also offers a small  benefit to ethereal characters, too: their movement rates are increased by 50%, so a     character with a movement rate of 12 would enjoy a movement rate of 18 while this spell  was in effect. Of course, time and distance have little meaning in the overall scheme of  the Astral or Ethereal Planes, but relative speed could be very important in avoiding an  unpleasant encounter or escaping from pursuit of some kind.

The action in question must be one  that would normally be resolved by a die roll, but the priest doesn’t have to be the person  who attempts the feat; he can use calculate to estimate the odds for anyone taking an  action in his sight. The priest has a 70% chance, +2% per level, of making an accurate  estimate.    If successful, the DM reveals to the player the action’s chance for success or any  modifiers that may be in play. For example, he could reveal a particular opponent’s  Armor Class or THAC0, the saving throw an opponent would require in order to save  against a particular spell cast by the priest or the priest’s wizard companion, or a  character’s chance to open doors, bend bars, or use a thief ability. The priest could even  calculate his odds for actions that might be resolved by a die roll or DM caprice, such as  his chance to avoid detection by hiding behind a rock. This spell takes into account  factors that the priest himself may not be aware of, so from time to time a character may  receive some very confusing results from this spell. For instance, if the priest doesn’t  know that an orc chieftain is actually a polymorphed tanar’ri masquerading as an orc, he  may be astonished to learn that the “orc” has a THAC0 of 7!    If the priest fails his calculation check with a roll of 99 or 00, his calculation is  wildly skewed in a random fashion.

    "description": "   The most humble of priestly spells is the orison, a brief prayer or invocation of a  minor nature. Typically, priests learn a number of orisons as acolytes or students in order  to hone their spellcasting skills and emphasize concepts, ideals, or phrases of particular  importance to the faith. Because an orisons is not even on par with other 1st-level magic,  a priest memorizes a number of individual orisons equal to three  +1 per level (up to a  maximum of nine) when he devotes a 1st-level spell slot to orison. In other words, a  1st-level priest can memorize four orisons for one 1st-level spell slot, a 2nd-level priest  can memorize five, and so on.    Unlike cantrip, an orison must have a specific effect, although the priest need not  decide which incantation he will use until he actually casts the spell. Regardless of the  prayer chosen, the orison’s duration is never more than one round per level. Known     orisons include the following:       Alleviate: A single creature suffering from nausea or pain is relieved of its  discomfort. Magically induced nausea or pain is only alleviated if the victim passes a  saving throw vs. spell with a –2 penalty.     Calm: A single creature that has been startled or frightened is soothed. Victims  suffering from magical fear may attempt a save vs. spell with a –2 penalty to calm  themselves.     Clarity: For the duration of the orison, the priest’s speech is clear and free of  impediment—useful for readings from sacred texts and other such rites. Magical  conditions such as confuse languages cannot be overcome by this orison.     Courage: The priest gains a +1 bonus to his next attack roll, as long as the attack  is made within the spell’s duration.     Guidance: The priest gains a +1 bonus to a Wisdom or Intelligence check to  determine the right course of action in a moral dilemma or puzzle.     Healing: By his touch, the priest may heal a creature of 1 point of damage.     Magic sense: If there is a persistent spell effect or magical item within 10 yards,  the priest feels a recognizable tingle or sensation of some kind. He has no way to  determine what item or spell may have caused the reaction.     Memory: Any item the priest commits to memory during the spell duration is  more completely and permanently learned; he gains a +2 bonus to any checks to recall  the exact appearance, wording, or meaning of an item, text, or message.     Resistance to magic: The caster gains a +1 bonus to his next saving throw  against magic of any type, as long as it occurs during the orison’s duration.     Resistance to poison: The priest gains a +1 bonus to his next saving throw vs.  poison, as long as it occurs during the orison’s duration.    Other orisons of similar power or scope may be permitted by the DM. Generally,  an orison should not affect more than one creature or die roll at a time, and an orison that  can actually cause immediate harm to a creature should inflict no more than 1 or 2 points  of damage. An offensive orison would be quite rare and most probably associated with an  evil or chaotic priesthood. "

The spell gives no indication of the \"direction\" in which the alignment  is removed from true Neutral except under certain conditions which follow. The spell  does, however, indicate along which axis or axes of alignment the variation lies.    For example, a priest uses this spell to analyze the balance of a Chaotic Neutral  creature. The spell indicates that the creature is removed from Neutral by one grade, and  the variation is along the Law/Chaos axis; thus, the creature must be either Chaotic  Neutral or Lawful Neutral. If the creature were Chaotic Evil, the spell would indicate that it is removed from balance by two grades, one along each axis; thus, the creature must be  Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Good, Lawful Evil, or Lawful Good.    A priest has a 5% chance per level of correctly determining the direction of variation  along one randomly chosen axis. This means that a 10th-level priest evaluating the  balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature would have a 50% chance of learning that the  creature is Chaotic (and hence Chaotic Neutral, since it is only one step away from  balance).    Similar to spells such as detect evil, this spell will not yield a result on a hidden trap.  If cast on a creature with an intelligence level of \"animal\" or \"non-,\" it will always read  true Neutral (i.e., zero steps removed from balance).

To cast this spell,  the priest must have an uninterrupted line of sight to the target unit.    A courage spell enables a unit to automatically pass its first morale check following  the casting of this spell. When circumstances arise that would necessitate a morale check,  no die roll is made and the unit is assumed to have passed the check. After this occurs,  the spell ends and the unit must make all future morale checks normally.    If a unit under the influence of a courage spell is not forced to make any morale  checks, the spell expires at the first sunset.    When several different events simultaneously trigger morale checks, the  BATTLESYSTEM™  rules apply penalties to a single morale check. If this occurs to a  unit under the influence of a courage spell, the player commanding the unit selects one  such event and its modifier is ignored.    No more than one courage spell can affect a unit at one time. Once the spell has  expired, a priest can cast the spell again on the same unit.    The material component is a cube of cast iron.  "

This  reading is neither deep nor specific and cannot pick out mixed emotions or intricate  details. For example, it might tell the priest that the subject is fearful, but the spell cannot  reveal what the subject is afraid of or why he is afraid.    Emotion read does not reveal individual thoughts or the subject's motivation. Thus,  the spell might reveal that the subject is coldly unemotional at the moment, but not the  fact that the subject is contemplating the cold-blooded murder of the priest.   Note that this reading is instantaneous. It reveals only the emotion that is strongest at  the instant the spell is used. While this will usually be related to the subject's overall  emotional state, it is always possible that the subject might be distracted for a moment or  remember and respond to past events.    The subject is allowed a normal saving throw vs. spells to resist this spell. If the  saving throw is successful, the priest receives no reading at all. If the subject's roll  exceeds the necessary number by six or more, the priest perceives an emotion  diametrically opposite to the subject's true emotion.    The material component is a square of unmarked white wax.  "

The new message is completely legible and is  recognizable as the handwriting of the original author, but is contrary in content to the  original message.    After the spell is cast, the message will appear different every day. The DM decides  the message that the page will carry after the sixth day has passed. Following is a sample  of the changes that could take place in a message.    Day One: The words of the letter appear faint, as if the author of the letter was  running out of ink as he wrote.    Day Two: The words have moved slightly from their original positions, as if the  person writing the letter were shaking or in a moving carriage when the letter was  written.   Days Three and Four: The message is gibberish. Although the ink forms groups of  letters arranged in lines with punctuation, nearly all the words are meaningless. This may  appear to be some sort of code, but it means nothing.    Day Five: The ink has formed real words. However, the sentence construction is still  meaningless (e.g., Egg west worse green!).    Day Six (and beyond): The message is coherent, but the opposite intent of the original  message has been created. If the original letter read, \"Send troops quickly,\" the new letter  reads, \"All is fine. Keep your men in reserve.\"    If mistaken missive is cast on the pages of a spellbook or a scroll, the ink on the page  reforms into a new spell of the same level as the original spell. Thus, a darkness spell  might become a maze spell. However, the spell formula will be wrong. Although it will  look like a proper spell, it will not function when cast.    A coded message that is subjected to mistaken missive will appear as a coded message  on the sixth day but will hold a different meaning than the original message.    A glass of preserved words will allow the original message to be read correctly.  Dispel magic will restore the message to its original form.    The material component is three drops of ink.  "

For  example, the priest might learn that the subject was born in the woods and moved to the  city only after hardship made his life untenable. Specific information is up to the DM.  The DM might provide some or all of the following information.    • The subject's character class or career        The subject's approximate level (stated in terms such as \"novice,\" \"highly skilled,\"       \"moderately competent,\" etc.)     • The subject's standing in the community (\"highly respected,\" \"mistrusted,\"       \"considered an enigma,\" etc.)     • The subject's success or failure in his profession     • The subject's prevailing character traits or mannerisms         If the priest casts the spell based on an alias or incorrect birth information, the reading  will be inaccurate.

The subject need not be present during the casting. The priest can cast the spell  without ever having met the subject.

At the end of the casting, the priests involved join hands, thus completing the spell. If any  priest breaks the circle, the spell immediately ceases. The priests may not move from  their locations but are free to speak. They may not cast spells requiring a somatic or  material component while the ring is formed.    The ring of hands forms a protective barrier around the priests and everything within  their circle. For each priest, assume a five-foot circumference of the circle; thus, three  priests would create a circle of 15-foot circumference. For easy calculation, assume that  for each priest, the circle can accommodate four persons.    The barrier functions as a protection from evil spell. Attacks by evil creatures suffer a  -1 penalty for every priest forming the circle. Saving throws made by the priests or  anyone in the circle against attacks from such creatures receive a +1 bonus for every  priest in the circle.    Attempts at mental control over protected creatures are blocked. Extraplanar and  conjured creatures are unable to touch the priests and those within the circle, although  melee attacks against such creatures by those within the ring break the barrier.    Because the priests casting the spell cannot move and must hold hands, they do not  receive any Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class. Furthermore, opponents gain a +2 bonus  on attack rolls against the priests, since there is little they can do to avoid a blow.  Creatures within the ring are free to act as they wish. Melee attacks by those within the  ring are limited to piercing weapons and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls since the  priests intervene.    The reverse of this spell, ring of woe, functions as detailed above except the effect  applies to good creatures as would a protection from good spell.  "

    "description": "One of the more bizarre contentions held by priests of the School of Thought is  generally scoffed at by outsiders. The theory states that once a thought has occurred in  someone's brain, it exists as a \"freestanding mental object.\" This \"thought object\" usually  remains inside the brain of the creature that created it, but sometimes it escapes (this  supposedly explains why people forget things). When this happens, the thought object  stays in the geographical area where it was lost. Any receptive brain (usually the brain of  the creature that initially created the thought) can pick it up again simply by bumping into  the invisible, free-floating thought. According to the theory, this is the reason that people  can regain a lost thought by going back to the location where the thought was lost. This  supposedly works because the free-floating thought is recaptured, not because the locale  reminds them of the thought. Unfortunately for philosophers who disagree with this,  thought capture seems to be extremely strong evidence for this theory.    This spell makes the priest's brain something of a magnet that attracts thought objects  in close proximity. The priest can sense strong thoughts and emotions and can sometimes  even see momentary visions of creatures who died or suffered some powerful emotion in  the immediate vicinity. Thought objects are always attracted to the priest in the order of  the strongest (those attached to powerful emotions or significant events) to the weakest.  Thus, if several thought objects share the same vicinity, the priest will perceive  information about the most interesting or significant event. The priest might pick up  images of a battle from the point of view of a warrior who died there, or he might gain  information about the victor of the battle.    The DM dictates the information provided to the priest, and thus can use this spell to  provide players with important background information or can add texture to a campaign  world. The information provided might be highly cryptic or symbolic, perhaps in the  form of a rhyme or riddle.    The priest gains one thought object per casting of the spell. The spell may be cast a  number of times in the same locale, with the priest gaining a different thought object with  each casting. A locale contains a finite number of thoughts, however, and once the priest  has gained all of them (per the DM), the spell will fail in that locale.  "

    "description": "The priest casting an augury spell seeks to divine whether an action in the immediate future (within one-half hour) will benefit or harm the party. For example, if a party is considering the destruction of a weird seal that closes a portal, an augury spell can be used to find if weal or woe will be the immediate result. If the spell is successful, the DM yields some indication of the probable outcome: \"weal,\" \"woe,\" or possibly a cryptic puzzle or rhyme. The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70%, plus 1% foreach level of the priest casting the spell; for example, 71% at 1st level, 72% at 2nd, etc. Your DM determines any adjustments for the particular conditions of each augury. For example, if the question is \"Will we do well if we venture to the third level?\" and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 sp and a shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the level (which the DM estimates the party could beat after a hard fight), the augury might be: \"Great risk brings great reward.\" If the troll is too strong for the party, the augury might be: \"Woe and destruction await!\" Likewise, a party casting several auguries about the same action in quick succession might receive identical answers, regardless of the dice rolls. The material component for an augury spell is a set of gem-inlaid sticks, dragon bones, or similar tokens of at least 1,000 gp value (which are not expended in casting)."

The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter is included, while an ogre is not. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. Thus, a charmed creature would not obey a suicide command, but might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the creature to hold back an onrushing red dragon for \"just a minute or two\" and if the charmed creature's view of the situation suggests that this course of action still allows a reasonable chance of survival. The subject's attitudes and priorities are changed with respect to the caster, but basic personality and alignment are not. A request that a victim make itself defenseless, give up a valued item, or even use a charge from a valued item (especially against former associates or allies) might allow an immediate saving throw to see if the charm is thrown off. Likewise, a charmed creature does not necessarily reveal everything it knows or draw maps of entire areas. Any request may be refused, if such refusal is in character and does not directly harm the caster. The victim's regard for the caster does not necessarily extend to the caster's friends or allies. The victim does not react well to the charmer's allies making suggestions such as, \"Ask him this question. . .,\" nor does the charmed creature put up with verbal or physical abuse from the charmer's associates, if this is out of character. Note also that the spell does not empower the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally has. The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed creature's Intelligence, and it is tied to the saving throw. A successful saving throw breaks the spell. This saving throw is checked on a periodic basis according to the creature's Intelligence, even if the caster has not overly strained the relationship. Intelligence Score Period Between Checks 3 or less 3 months 4-6 2 months 7-9 1 month 10-12 3 weeks 13-14 2 weeks15-16 1 week 17 3 days 18 2 days 19 or more 1 day If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed creature by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creature, the charm is broken automatically. If the subject of the charm person/charm mammal spell successfully rolls its saving throw vs. the spell, the effect is negated. This spell, if used in conjunction with the animal friendship spell, can keep the animal near the caster's home base, if the caster must leave for an extended period."

The dust devil can hold a gas cloud or a creature in gaseous form at bay or push it away from the caster (though it cannot damage or disperse such a cloud). If skimming along the ground in an area of loose dust, sand, or ash, the dust devil picks up those particles and disperses them in a 10-foot-diameter cloud centered on itself. The cloud obscures normal vision, and creatures caught within are blinded while inside and for one round after they emerge. A spellcaster caught in the dust devil or its cloud while casting must make a saving throw vs. spell to keep his concentration, or the spell is ruined.

Thereafter, the enchantment lasts as long as the priest speaks, to a maximum of one hour.

Note: When handling a large number of saving throws for similar creatures, the DM can assume an average to save time; for example, a crowd of 20 men with a base saving throw of 16 (25% success chance) will have 15 men enthralled and five not."

Note that this spell is directional, and the caster must face the desired direction in order to determine if a trap is laid in that particular direction. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the harmful or undesirable result was specifically intended as such by the creator. Thus, traps include alarms, glyphs, and similar spells or devices. The caster learns the general nature of the trap (magical or mechanical) but not its exact effect, nor how to disarm it. Close examination will, however, enable the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. Note that the caster's divination is limited to his knowledge of what might be unexpected and harmful. The spell cannot predict actions of creatures (hence, a concealed murder hole or ambush is not a trap), nor are natural hazards considered traps (a cavern that floods during a rain, a wall weakened by age, a naturally poisonous plant, etc.). If the DM is using specific glyphs or sigils to identify magical wards (see the 3rd-level spell glyph of warding), this spell shows the form of the glyph or mark.

A knock spell cannot affect a fire trap in any way--as soon as the offending party opens the item, the trap discharges. As with most magical traps, a thief has only half his normal find traps score to detect a fire trap. Failure to remove it successfully detonates it immediately. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell will not detonate the spell. When the trap is discharged, there will be an explosion of 5-foot radius from the spell's center. All creatures within this area must roll saving throws vs. spell. Damage is 1d4 points plus 1 point per level of the caster, and half that total amount for creatures successfully saving. (Under water, this ward inflicts half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.) The item trapped is not harmed by this explosion. The caster can use the trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the spell was specifically attuned when cast (the method usually involves a key word). To place this spell, the caster must trace the outline of the closure with a stick of charcoal and touch the center of the effect.

On the first round of the spell, the metal merely becomes very warm and uncomfortable to touch (this is also the effect on the last melee round of the spell's duration). During the second and sixth (next to the last) rounds, heat causes blisters and damage; in the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal becomes searing hot, causing damage to exposed flesh, as shown below: Metal Temperature Damage per Round very warm none hot 1d4 points searing* 2d4 points * On the final round of searing, the afflicted creature must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer one of the following disabilities: hand or foot--becomes unusable for 2d4 days; body--becomes disabled for 1d4 days; head--fall unconscious for 1d4 turns. This effect can be completely removed by the 6th-level priest spell heal spell or by normal rest. Note also that materials such as wood, leather, or flammable cloth smolder and burn if exposed to searing hot metal. Such materials cause searing damage to exposed flesh on the next round. Fire resistance (spell, potion, or ring) or a protection from fire spell totally negates the effects of a heat metal spell, as does immersion in water or snow, or exposure to a cold or ice storm spell. This version of the spell does not function under water. For every two experience levels of the caster, the metal of one man-sized creature can be affected (i.e., arms and armor, or a single mass of metal equal to 50 pounds of weight). Thus, a 3rd-level caster would affect one such creature, a 4th- or 5th-level caster two, etc. The reverse of the spell, chill metal, counters a heat metal spell or else causes metal to act as follows: Metal Temperature Damage per Round cold none icy 1-2 points freezing* 1d4 points* On the final round of freezing, the afflicted creature must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer from the numbing effects of the cold. This causes the loss of all feeling in a hand (or hands, if the DM rules the saving throw was failed badly) for 1d4 days. During this time, the character's grip is extremely weak and he cannot use that hand for fighting or any other activity requiring a firm grasp.

The spell grants the creature complete immunity to mild conditions (standing naked in the snow or reaching into an ordinary fire to pluck out a note). The recipient can somewhat resist intense heat or cold (whether natural or magical in origin), such as red-hot charcoal, a large amount of burning oil, flaming swords, fire storms, fireballs, meteor swarms, red dragon's breath, frostbrand swords, ice storms, wands of frost, or white dragon's breath. In all of these cases, the temperature affects the creature to some extent. The recipient of the spell gains a bonus of +3 to saving throws against such attack forms and all damage sustained is reduced by 50%; therefore, if the saving throw is failed, the creature sustains one-half damage, and if the saving throw is successful, the creature sustains only one-quarter damage. Resistanceto fire lasts for one round for each experience level of the priest placing the spell. The caster needs a drop of mercury as the material component of this spell."

As long as the caster concentrates upon the hammer, it strikes at any opponent within its range, as desired. Each round the caster canchoose to attack the same target as the previous round or switch to a new target that he can see anywhere within his maximum range. The spiritual hammer's chance to successfully hit is equal to that of the caster, without any Strength bonuses. In addition, it strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every six experience levels (or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4+1 points on opponents of man size or smaller, or 1d4 points on larger opponents, plus the magical bonus). The hammer strikes in the same direction as the caster is facing, so if he is behind the target, all bonuses for rear attack are gained along with the loss of any modifications to the target's AC for shield and Dexterity. As soon as the caster ceases concentration, the spiritual hammer spell ends. A dispel magic spell that includes either the caster or the force in its area of effect has a chance to dispel the spiritual hammer. If an attacked creature has magic resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the spiritual hammer strikes. If the hammer is successfully resisted, the spell is lost. If not, the hammer has its normal full effect for the duration of the spell. The material component of this spell is a normal war hammer that the priest must hurl toward opponents while uttering a plea to his deity. The hammer disappears when the spell is cast."

Note that only as many creatures can be tripped as are actually stepping across the enchanted object. Thus, a 3-foot-long piece of rope could trip only one man-sized creature. Creatures moving at a very rapid pace (running) when tripped suffer 1 point of damage and are stunned for 1d4+1 rounds if the surface they fall upon is very hard (if it is turf or other soft material, they are merely stunned for the rest of that round). Very large creatures, such as elephants, are not affected at all by a trip spell. The object continues to trip all creatures passing over it, including the spellcaster, for as long as the spell duration lasts. A creature aware of the object and its potential adds a +4 bonus to its saving throw roll when crossing the object. The enchanted object is 80% undetectable unless a means that detects magical traps is employed or the operation of the spell is observed. This spell does not function under water."

The range of a warp wood spell is 10 yards for each level of experience of the caster. It affects approximately a 15- inch shaft of wood of up to 1-inch diameter per level of the caster. Thus, at 1st level, a caster might be able to warp a hand axe handle or four crossbow bolts; at 5th level, he could warp the shaft of a typical spear. Note that boards or planks can also be affected, causing a door to be sprung or a boat or ship to leak. Warped missile weapons are useless; warped melee weapons suffer a -4 penalty to their attack rolls. Enchanted wood is affected only if the spellcaster is of higher level than the caster of the prior enchantment. The spellcaster has a 20% cumulative chance of success per level of difference (20% if one level higher, 40% if two levels higher, etc.). Thus, a door magically held or wizard locked by a 5th-level wizard is 40% likely to be affected by a warp wood spell cast by a 7th-level priest. Wooden magical items are considered enchanted at 12th level (or better). Extremely powerful items, such as artifacts, are unaffected by this spell.

(The DM should allow the player one minute of real time per round withdrawn to ponder some problem or question. No discussion with other players is permitted.) Note that while affected by the withdraw spell, the caster can use only the following spells: any divination spell or any curing or healing spell, the latter on himself only. The casting of any of these spells in different fashion (for example, a cure light wounds spell bestowed upon a companion) negates the withdraw spell. Similarly, the withdrawn caster cannot walk or run, become invisible, or engage in actions other than thinking, reading, and the like. He can be affected by the actions of others, losing any Dexterity or shield bonus. Any successful attack upon the caster breaks the spell."

A successful saving throw indicates that the subject creature was missed by the attack of the wyvern- form, and the spell remains in place.

Unlike the emotion spell, calm chaos does not cause a change in the emotions of  affected creatures--anger, fear, or intense joy remain in each individual. The emotion is  simply restrained rather than released. Thus, an angry character intent on attacking  someone will still feel the desire to do so, but he will withhold his action as long as the  spell remains in effect.    Creatures to be affected are allowed a saving throw vs. spell at a -4 penalty to avoid  the effects. If more creatures are present than can be affected, creatures nearest the caster  are affected first.    After casting the spell, the priest makes a Charisma check. If successful, all characters  affected by the spell are compelled to stop what they are doing. They are filled with the  sensation that something important is about to occur. At this time, the priest or a  character of his choosing must gain the attention of the affected creatures by giving a  speech, performing for the crowd, or casting spells with intriguing visual effects (such as  dancing lights). The attention of the crowd is then held for as long as the distraction  continues. A character could filibuster and maintain control over the affected characters  for hours or days.    Two conditions will cause the group to resume its original actions. In the first, the  method of entertaining the crowd ceases for one round--the speech ends or the spell  expires. If this action is not replaced with another distraction within one round, the crowd  is freed of the spell.    In the second condition, if an event occurs that is more immediate than the  distraction, the crowd will divert its attention to that event. Thus, if the spell were used to  stop a barroom brawl and the building caught fire or was attacked, the crowd's attention  would be diverted and the individuals could act freely.    Creatures whose attention is held by the spell cannot be instructed to attack or  perform any action. Such creatures will ignore suggestions of this nature. Depending on  the nature of the request, the DM may deem that the suggestion causes a distraction that  ends the spell.

The enchanted object can sprout feet (MV 24), wings (Fl 24, maneuverability class  B), or fins (Sw 24), whichever is most advantageous. Thus, a book on a shelf might  sprout wings and fly away, while a table might gallop around a room. The enchanted  object can freely and instantly trade appendages as necessary.    The enchanted object will move only through open spaces. It will not crash through  windows, shatter a closed door, or dig through the earth. It cannot attack or take any  actions other than movement. If surrounded or cornered, the enchanted object moves in  random directions until it is restrained or destroyed.

Restraint means that  the object is prevented from fleeing; if a creature is able to grapple, lift, or sit on the  object, it is considered restrained. A creature capable of lifting the object in its normal  state is considered strong enough to restrain it (for instance, a person capable of lifting a  50-pound box is also capable of restraining such a box enchanted by frisky chest).

    "description": "This spell is a sensitive version of the wizard spell ESP. In addition to detecting the  surface thoughts of any creatures in range, the priest is able to probe deeper into the mind  of a single creature. Mind read will always reveal the kind of creature being probed,  although this identity may be couched in the creature's own language or in a (possibly  distorted) body image. The spell has a 20% chance of revealing the character class of an  individual.    The details and the usefulness of the creature's thoughts will depend on the  intelligence of the subject. While a priest could read the thoughts of an animal, he would  probably receive only a confused jumble of emotions and instincts. Reading the mind of a  highly intelligent wizard, however, would be much more illuminating; the priest might be  amazed by the crystal clarity and deep insight of the wizard's mental processes.    If mind read is used as part of an interrogation, an intelligent and wary subject  receives a saving throw at a -2 penalty. If successful, the creature resists the spell's effects  and the priest learns no information. If the saving throw is failed, the priest may learn  additional information according to the DM's ruling.  "

    "description": "Theoretically, every action has a particular moment at which it will have its greatest  possible effect. Using the arcane mathematics of this spell, the priest can determine the  \"ideal moment\" for any single action in each round that the spell is in effect. This action  must be performed by a character other than the priest.    In practice, another character informs the priest of an action he wants to undertake in  a round. The priest concentrates on the action, then informs the character when the  \"correct moment\" has come. The character then gains a bonus of 20% (+4 on a d20) to  the success of his action. The spell can affect only a single action in a given round. When  used in combat, the priest can advise the best moment to initiate an action (affecting  initiative) or what moment offers the greatest success in striking (affecting the chance to  hit).    If the character seeks advice concerning initiative, he gains a -2 modifier to the initiative roll, but only at the cost of -2 on his chance to hit. Characters who seek the best  attack frequently delay their actions. These characters suffer a +1 on their initiative roll  but gain a +4 on their chance to hit. The spell cannot affect the amount of damage caused,  since the act (striking) has already succeeded at that point.    Characters are not obliged to wait for the moment specified by the priest. For  example, a fighter might decide that striking first is more important than gaining +4 to  hit. The character can act normally, based on his or her unmodified initiative. The  character gains no bonus from the moment spell, and the priest can affect no other action  in that round.  Noncombat actions can also benefit from the moment spell. For example, a thief planning  to climb a wall may wait to start her climb until the priest informs her that the moment is  right. If she waits, she gains a bonus of 20% to her Climb Walls roll (in this case, the  bonus is subtracted from her roll).    While concentrating on this spell, the priest can take no other action. A break in the  priest's concentration--taking damage in combat, for example--terminates the spell  instantly.    The material component is a set of three silver dice, which the priest tosses in his  hand while concentrating on the spell. The dice are not consumed in the casting.  "

In addition, the music makes the subject gullible and more susceptible to charm  magics such as charm person, suggestion, and hypnotism. While the music spell is in  effect, the subject saves against charm spells with a -3 penalty.    This spell does not protect other characters in company with the priest; listeners who  have fallen prey to the music are free to attack anyone else. The spell effect ends instantly  if the priest takes any hostile action against a creature under the influence of the spell.    Music of the spheres can affect one creature per three levels of the priest (one subject  at 3rd level, two at 6th level, etc.). Subjects must be within a 20-foot-diameter circle.    Potential victims must have Intelligence of at least 1 (necessary to understand the  concept of music) and must be able to hear the music (i.e., they cannot be deaf and there  can be nothing obstructing the victim's ears). This also means that the level of  background noise must be low enough for the music to be audible. The DM should  assume that the music is the same volume as an average human's normal speaking voice.

    "description": "This spell is one of the few cooperative spells that requires one priest to cast the  transfer spell, but another priest to use its effect. On one round, a priest (or priests) casts  the mystic transfer. The spell is then active for the remaining nine rounds of the turn.    Mystic transfer allows a priest to receive spells from another priest of the same ethos.  Any priest of the same religion can cast a spell and transfer it to a second priest within  that spell's maximum range. The spell does not take effect; instead, it is channelled  through the mystic transfer into the receiving priest. This priest must immediately cast the  spell or pass it to another priest cloaked in a mystic transfer within the spell's range. Any  number of transfers can be made in the same round, provided each new recipient is within  spell range of the previous recipient. If the spell is not transferred, the spell takes effect.    For example, a 3rd-level priest casts a mystic transfer. On the following round, a  10th-level priest \"passes\" a flame strike to the 3rd-level priest. The two priests could be  60 yards apart (the maximum range of the flame strike). The 3rd-level priest could then  use the flame strike to attack any target within 60 yards, or could pass the spell on to  another priest who has an active mystic transfer.    The spell passed by the mystic transfer has the range, area of effect, damage, and  other effects equal to the level of the original caster. In the example above, the flame  strike would function as if cast by a 10th-level priest.    The mystic transfer does not require concentration. However, on any round in which  a priest is receiving and/or transferring a spell, the caster cannot take any other significant  action.    A priest can receive spells only from priests who worship the same deity and who  specifically target spells to him. Area effect spells may be passed. A priest can never use  mystic transfer to pluck an opponent's spells out of the air.  "

Companions of similar alignment to the casters will feel fortified and  encouraged while in the sanctified area. The spell can be cast by a single priest or a group  of priests.   After casting sanctify, the affected area is imbued with the deity's majesty. For  followers of that deity, the area radiates a holy aura. These followers gain a +2 bonus to  saving throws against all fear- and charm-based powers (a +2 to morale for  BATTLESYSTEM™ rules units). Persons of the same alignment as the caster but of  different faiths gain a +1 to saving throws (+1 in BATTLESYSTEM rules). The effect  applies only as long as the characters remain in the sanctified area.    Creatures intent on harming the priest or his followers suffer a -1 on saving throws vs.  fear and charm (-1 to morale for BATTLESYSTEM rules units) when on sanctified  ground.    Undead creatures within the area are easier to turn; any priest standing on sanctified  ground turns undead as if he were one level higher.    Although this spell can be cast by a single priest, it is most effective when cast by  several priests at once. The duration of the spell is equal to one round per level of the  caster. When several priests cast the spell, the level of the most powerful priest is used,  with two rounds added for every contributing priest. Thus, one 8th-level and three 6th- level priests would give the spell a duration of 14 rounds (8+2+2+2).    Sanctify is often used in conjunction with focus to protect the grounds of a temple or  encourage men defending a castle.    The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dirt from the  grounds of an existing temple of the same faith.    The reverse of this spell, defile, functions in an identical manner with respect to  saving throws for charm and fear. However, priests standing on defiled ground who  attempt to turn undead do so at one level lower than their current level.    The material components for the reverse are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of  earth from a grave.  "

The heartbeat of each person, animal, or monster in the area of effect is clearly distinct and may convey information about the being's proximity, direction, size, emotional distress, general health, and race or species. For instance, the heartbeat of a frail old wizard would be much softer and weaker than that of the invisible ogre bodyguard, standing behind him. This spell can provide quite confusing results if cast in the presence of numerous individuals (such as on a crowded city street) and is most effective when cast by a cleric in relative seclusion. A priest never hearshis or her own heartbeat with this spell. It is effectively masked out by the power of the hear heartbeat spell. Obviously, this spell is of little use with creatures without functioning hearts (such as plants or undead). The spell's range is diminished if more than a one- inch thickness of wood, stone, or metal lies between the caster and a subject. Each inch of a barrier's thickness should be treated as 10' of open space. The material component is beeswax mixed with a tiny drop of the priest's own blood (to block the sound of his or her own heartbeat). While casting the spell, the priest places the wax in his ears to blot out normal sound and trigger the magical effect.

The skeletons or zombies can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place, etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled. The priest can animate one skeleton or one zombie for each experience level he has attained. If creatures with more than 1+ Hit Dice are animated, the number is determined by the monster Hit Dice. Skeletal forms have the Hit Dice of the original creature, while zombie forms have 1 more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level priest could animate 12 dwarven skeletons (or six zombies), four zombie gnolls, or a single zombie fire giant. Note thatthis is based on the standard racial Hit Die norm; thus, a high-level adventurer would be animated as a skeleton or zombie of 1 or 2 Hit Dice, and without special class or racial abilities. The caster can, alternatively, animate two small animal skeletons (1-1 Hit Die or less) for every level of experience he has achieved. The spell requires a drop of blood, a piece of flesh of the type of creature being animated, and a pinch of bone powder or a bone shard to complete the spell.

The caster need not call a bolt of lightning immediately--other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed; however, the caster must remain stationary and concentrate for a full round each time a bolt is called.

In the third case, the continual light affects the space about 1 foot behind a creature that successfully rolls its saving throw vs.spell (a failed saving throw means the continual light is centered on the creature and moves as it moves). Note that this spell also blinds a creature if it is successfully cast upon the creature's visual organs. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a light-proof covering, the spell effects are blocked until the covering is removed. Continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) cancels the darkness so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of a continual light spell against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both. This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far longer than the time in a typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials might last hundreds or even thousands of years.

To be effective, the priest must touch the intended victim, and the victim must fail a saving throw vs. spell. The severity of the disease is decided by the priest (debilitating or fatal). The exact details of the disease are decided by the DM, but the following are typical: Debilitating: The disease takes effect in 1d6 turns, after which the creature loses 1 point of Strength per hour until his Strength is reduced to 2 or less, at which time the recipient is weak and virtually helpless. If a creature has no Strength rating, it loses 10% of its hit points per Strength loss, down to 10% of its original hit points. If the disease also affects hit points, use the more severe penalty. Recovery requires a period of 1d3 weeks. Fatal: This wasting disease is effective immediately. Infected creatures receive no benefit from cure wound spells while the disease is in effect; wounds heal at only 10% of the natural rate. The disease proves fatal within 1d6 months and can be cured only by magical means. Each month the disease progresses, the creature loses 2 points of Charisma, permanently. The inflicted disease can be cured by the cure disease spell. Lycanthropy cannot be caused. "

    "description": "A glyph of warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorizedor hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. The priest must set the conditions of the ward; typically any creature violating the warded area without speaking the name of the glyph is subject to the magic it stores. A successful saving throw vs. spell enables the creature to escape the effects of the glyph. Glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics, such as creature type, size, and weight. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good or evil, or to pass those of the caster's religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area; although if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be separately warded. When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. For every 5 square feet of area to be protected, one round is required to trace the warding lines of the glyph. The caster can affect an area equal to a square the sides of which are the same as his level, in feet. The glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of the caster's total square footage. Thus, a 6th-level caster could place a glyph on a 6-foot x 6-foot square, a 4-foot x 9-foot rectangle, a 2-foot x 18- foot band, or a 1-foot by 36-foot strip. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become invisible. The priest traces the glyph with incense, which, if the area exceeds 50 square feet, must be sprinkled with powdered diamond (at least 2,000 gp worth). Typical glyphs shock for 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the spellcaster, explode for a like amount of fire damage, paralyze, blind, deafen, and so forth. The DM may allow any harmful priest spell effect to be used as a glyph, provided the caster is of sufficient level to cast the spell. Successful saving throws either reduce effects by one- half or negate them, according to the glyph employed. Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled by magic and foiled by high-level thieves using their find-and-remove-traps skill. The DM may decide that the exact glyphs available to a priest depend on his religion, and he might make new glyphs available according to the magical research rules."

The magic lasts for 1d8+8 rounds, with the variable part of the duration rolled secretly by the DM.

Note that the area must have brush and trees in it in order for this spell to take effect. Briars, bushes, creepers, lianas, roots, saplings, thistles, thorn, trees, vines, and weeds become so thick and overgrown in the area of effect as to form a barrier. The area of effect is a square 20 feet on a side per level of experience of the caster, in any square or rectangular shape that the caster decides upon at the time of the spellcasting. Thus, an 8th-level caster can affect a maximum area of a 160-foot x 160-foot square, a 320-foot x 80-foot rectangle, a 640-foot x 40-foot rectangle, a 1,280-foot x 20-foot rectangle, etc. The spell's effects persist in the area until it is cleared by labor, fire, or such magical means as a dispel magic spell. The second use of the spell affects a one-mile square area. The DM secretly makes a saving throw (based on the caster's level) to see if the spell takes effect. If successful, the spell renders plants more vigorous, fruitful, and hardy, increasing yields by 20% to 50% ([1d4+1] x 10%), given a normal growing season. The spell does not prevent disaster in the form of floods, drought, fire, or insects, although even in these cases the plants survive better than expected. This effect lasts only for the life cycle of one season, the winter \"death\" marking the end of a life cycle even for the sturdiest of trees.

If no such sapling or tree is available, the cordlike object tightens upon the member(s), then wraps around the entire creature, causing no damage, but tightly binding it. Under water, the cord coils back upon its anchor point. The snare is magical, so for one hour it is breakable only by cloud giant or greater Strength (23); each hour thereafter, the snare material loses magic so as to become 1 point more breakable per hour--22 after two hours, 21 after three, 20 after four--until six full hours have elapsed.

    "description": "The summon insects spell attracts a cloud or swarm of normal insects to attack the foes of the caster. Flying insects appear 70% of the time, while crawling insects appear 30% of the time. The exact insects called are bees, biting flies, hornets, or wasps, if flying insects are indicated; biting ants or pinching beetles, if crawling insects are indicated. A cloud of the flying type, or a swarm of the crawling sort, appears after the spell is cast. This gathers at a point chosen by the caster, within the spell's range, and attacks any single creature the caster points to. The attacked creature sustains 2 points of damage if it does nothing but attempt to flee or fend off the insects during the time it is attacked; it suffers 4 points of damage per round otherwise. If the insects are ignored, the victim fights with a -2 penalty to his attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor Class. If he attempts to cast a spell, an initiative roll should be made for the insects to see if their damage occurs before the spell is cast. If it does, the victim's concentration is ruined and the spell is lost. The insects disperse and the spell ends if the victim enters thick smoke or hot flames. Besides being driven off by smoke or hot flames, the swarm might possibly be outrun, or evaded by plunging into a sufficient body of water. If evaded, the summoned insects can be sent against another opponent, but there will be at least a 1 round delay while they leave the former opponent and attack the new victim. Crawling insects can travel only about 10 feet per round (maximum speed over smooth ground) and flying insects travel 60 feet per round. The caster must concentrate to maintain the swarm; it dissipates if he moves or is disturbed. It is possible, in underground situations, that the caster might summon 1d4 giant ants by means of the spell, but the possibility is only 30% unless giant ants are nearby. This spell does not function under water. The materials needed for this spell are the caster's holy symbol, a flower petal, and a bit of mud or wet clay."

The creature  is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell; if it fails, the caster may direct the creature with  simple commands to act in any fashion desired. Sample commands include attack, run,  fetch, etc. Suicidal or self-destructive commands grant the subject another saving throw  to break free of the caster’s control, with a +1 to +4 bonus depending on the extremity of  the caster’s orders. Ordering an animal to engage in combat is not necessarily  self-destructive, as long as the prospective opponent is not more than three times the  animal’s Hit Dice or more than two size categories larger than the subject. For example, a  wolf (3 Hit Dice, size M) would attack a troll (6+6 Hit Dice, size L) without hesitation,  but it might break free of the caster’s control if ordered to attack a size H dragon or an  8+8 HD umber hulk.    Control animal establishes a mental link between the caster and the subject, and  the animal can be directed by silent mental command as long as it remains within range.  Because the caster’s intelligence directs the animal, the creature may be able to take  actions normally beyond its own comprehension, such as manipulating objects with its  paws and mouth. The caster need not concentrate in order to maintain control of the  creature unless he is trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn’t.    Control animal only works on normal or giant-sized animals with Intelligence  ratings between 1 and 4. Magical animals, monsters, and creatures of low Intelligence or  higher are immune to the effects of this spell. Druids always avoid using this spell. "

While the spell is available as a  2nd-level enchantment for members of the Harmonium, the general version is not quite as  efficient and is considered a 3rd-level spell.    The dictate spell is an improved version of command, affecting up to 6 creatures  in a 20-foot cube. The caster is not limited to a single word and can issue an order of no  more than a dozen words in length. All the specified targets who fail their saving throws  must attempt to obey the caster’s instructions. For example, a priest could issue a dictate  such as “Stay here until I return,” “Throw down your weapons,” or “Seize that elf!” The  subjects will continue to obey nonimmediate orders for up to one round per experience  level of the caster.    Subjects who cannot understand the caster are not affected, so characters who do  not understand the caster’s language are immune to this spell. In addition, the order must  create an immediate and obvious course of action for the subject; a dictate to “Die!” or  “Feel sorry for him!” would simply cause the subject to stand still in confusion for one  round. Poorly worded or confusing commands grant the subjects a +1 to +4 bonus on  their saving throws at the DM’s discretion. Similarly, if after the subject fails his saving  throw he is given an obviously self-destructive dictate, the subject simply loses his next  round as he fights off the compulsion. "

Secondly, the priest may  not use this spell on an unwilling target and can only make another creature ethereal if the  subject is willing and in physical contact with the priest when the spell is cast. Besides  himself, the caster can bring one creature per two experience levels (three at 5th, four at     7th, five at 9th, and so on) to the Ethereal Plane. Even if the priest abandons his charges  in the Border Ethereal, the stranded characters will automatically materialize when the  spell ends.    While ethereal, the priest cannot be detected by any means short of a true seeing  or detect phase spell. He perceives his surroundings as misty, gray, and otherworldly. No  action he takes can affect the physical world, but he can pass through walls, doors, and  other solid objects without hindrance. The priest can choose to end the spell voluntarily at  any time, materializing in the physical world in one round. If the caster occupies a solid  object when the spell ends, he is hurled into the Deep Ethereal and stranded in a catatonic  stupor until he can be rescued. "

Fortify  may be used to prepare an open outdoors area such as a field, road, or grassland, or a  rough or broken outdoors area such as a hillside, forest, or boulder-fall. Large rooms or  chambers such as a cavern or a great hall may be fortified as well. The exact effects of the  spell depend on the nature of the site to be fortified.    A. Open Outdoors Site: A rampart or dike of earth and loose stone rises from the  ground along the perimeter of the site, leaving a shallow ditch on the outward face.  Creatures defending the dike receive 50% cover against missile fire (+4 bonus to AC), or  25% cover (+2 bonus) if they expose themselves by engaging in melee combat or firing  missiles out of the dike. Attackers cannot charge, run, or sprint over the ditch-and-dike.  Large, open rooms or chambers with few features may fall into this category.    B. Rough Outdoors Site: Loose stones and boulders, deadwood, and patches of  dense briars are arranged to form a defensible wall or rampart along the perimeter of the  area of effect. Characters hiding behind the wall receive 75% cover (+7 bonus to AC), or  50% cover if they expose themselves by firing missiles or defending the wall. In  hand-to-hand combat, the wall’s defenders receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls; man-sized  attackers must spend one full round in climbing over the wall in order to enter the  fortified area. Natural caverns and large, cluttered chambers fall into this category, as  well.    C. Marshy or Low-lying Site: In areas such as swamp, marsh, bog, or tundra,  fortify cannot raise a wall or dike to cover the defenders. Instead, the spell creates a  water-filled ditch around the perimeter of the area of effect. This ditch is 10 feet wide and  2 to 4 feet deep; most creatures require 1 full round to negotiate the ditch, and defenders  gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies who are wading the ditch or climbing up  the other side.       The fortifications are permanent, although erosion, weathering, and excavations,  clearing, or filling can quickly raze the site, returning it to its original state. The material  component is the shell of a snail dusted with 100 gold pieces worth of diamond powder.  In Battlesystem® rules, fortify provides a defending unit with a +2 bonus to its AR  against missile and melee attacks, but no bonus against missile attacks in marshy or  low-lying areas. "

    "description": "This spell summons a minor spirit or entity to the caster’s aid. Clerics usually  summon minor elementals of some kind, while shamans typically conjure an animal spirit  or spirit of nature. Regardless of the spirit’s origin, it appears as a ghostly beast of some  kind—wolves, bears, tigers, or lions are most common. The animal spirit obeys the  mental commands of the priest, attacking his enemies or performing any other task that it  could reasonably accomplish. The creature is incorporeal and cannot handle or  manipulate objects of any kind, but it can see and hear as a normal animal of its archetype  and could be used to scout a dangerous area or act as a distraction of some kind.    In combat, the animal spirit has the following statistics: MV 24; AC 4; THAC0  15; Dmg 2d4. It can only be injured by magical weapons and can strike monsters hit only  by +1 or better weapons. The spirit has a number of hit points equal to 10 plus the  caster’s level, so a 6th-level priest conjures a animal spirit with 16 hit points. The  creature is not affected by charm, sleep, hold, or other mind-affecting spells and suffers  no damage from cold-based attacks. However, it is vulnerable to dispel magic or turning  as an undead monster of the caster’s Hit Dice. If the animal spirit is turned, destroyed, or  dispelled, the priest who summoned it must make a saving throw vs. spell or be stunned  for 1d4 rounds.    Because the spirit is intelligent and free-willed under the caster’s direction, the  priest need not concentrate in order to direct its attacks—an animal spirit could be  ordered to attack a spellcaster in the back of an enemy party, while the cleric waded into  hand-to-hand combat. The animal spirit makes use of flank or rear attacks when it can  and gains any normal combat bonuses that a living creature in its position would be  entitled to. The priest enjoys instantaneous, silent communication with the animal spirit  and can order it to stop attacking, to change its target, or to undertake almost any  conceivable action desired. However, the spirit must remain within the spell’s range; if it  is ever more than 10 yards per caster level away from the priest, it dissipates harmlessly.    The material component is a small whistle carved from a bone taken from the  appropriate type of animal.  "

This spell can be used to indefinitely postpone the onset of a poison if the caster  chooses to continue to cast it on the poisoned character before the previous hold poison  wears off. However, each time a new hold poison is used to stop the venom’s advance for  another few days, there is a 2% cumulative chance that the spell fails and the poison runs  its course. Evil priests have been known to deliberately poison a person and then use this  spell to grant the victim a stay of death for a few days. This can be an extremely effective  threat if the victim doesn’t have access to a neutralize poison spell.

It can be  used to knit a broken bone, alleviate the swelling and pain of a sprain or a twist, or repair  soft-tissue damage such as an injured eye, ear, or a severed tendon. If used as a simple  curing spell, repair injury restores 1d10+1 hit points to the injured character, but if used  to address the effects of a specific injury, repair injury automatically removes one  grazed, struck, injured, or broken condition, and alleviates any combat, movement, or  maximum hit point penalties associated with the injury in question. The spell does not     restore any lost hit points to the victim, other than the 1d10+1 that are incidental to the  working of the spell.      Beran, a fighter with 44 hit points, is struck by an ogre’s club. The blow inflicts  12 points of damage, but Beran also suffers a broken hip. This injury will reduce him to a  maximum of 25% of his normal total, so Beran’s current hit points drop from 32 to 11  after the battle ends. In addition, he is not capable of moving or attacking due to the  effects of the injury.    When the smoke clears, Talmos the priest comes to Beran’s aid. Using repair  injury, he knits Beran’s broken hip. The spell cures 6 hit points in the process. Beran no  longer suffers the movement or attack penalties for a broken hip and has 17 hit points to  his credit. With time or additional healing, he can regain his normal total of 44.      Repair injury is also helpful in dealing with wounds that fall in the crushed,  shattered, or destroyed category. This spell reduces the severity of the injury to the  broken level, which means it heals as if it were 20d6 lost hit points. Only one repair  injury can be used on any given wound, so a character with a shattered knee could still  require a lot of time to recover after an application of this spell.    Severed limbs, destroyed eyes or ears, and ability score losses caused by injuries  cannot be healed by this spell. Repair injury is the equivalent of cure serious wounds for  the purpose of slowing or stopping bleeding. "

The spell operates  on a subconscious level, and the caster receives strong intuitive impulses when he  contemplates courses of action that may bring immediate physical injury or harm to him.  For example, if the priest was about to open a trapped chest, the unfailing premonition  would create a flash of insight or a gut feeling telling him that he shouldn’t do so.  Similarly, opening a door that leads into the lair of a ferocious troll may also trigger the  spell’s warning. Threatening a NPC who is likely to respond by drawing a weapon and  attacking the PC would create a warning, but threatening a NPC who will get even with  the priest in an hour or two will not trigger the premonition.    The unfailing premonition is also quite useful in combat, as long as the priest  obeys his instincts and ducks, dodges, or withdraws when his subconscious tells him to.  While the spell is in effect, the priest gains a +2 bonus to his Armor Class and saving  throws, but in any given round there is a 25% chance that he will have to forego his  intended action in order to obey the spell’s warning impulses.    The premonition only works on actions undertaken by the priest himself.

If an object is within the spell’s weight limit, the caster may direct the wind servant to carry it along in gusts and air currents at a flying movement rate of 12 (E). If the object leaves the limits of the spell’s range, the wind servant fails, and the object drops or falls normally from that point. Flying creatures of size M or smaller can be forced to land or be driven away by use of the spell if they fall within the weight limit, or slowed by 50% if they exceed the weight limit. Employing the wind servant against an arrow or light missile adds a penalty of –4 to the attack roll. In dusty, snowy, or sandy regions, the caster can instead use wind servant to create a vicious zephyr of stinging dust around an enemy. This zephyr inflicts damage equal to the opponent’s base AC less 2d6 points and creates a –2 penalty to the victim’s attack rolls. For example, an enemy in leather armor +1 (AC 7) would suffer 7 – 2d6 damage if attacked by means of this spell. Note that any use of the wind servant requires the priest’s undivided attention; he can take no other actions while directing the spell. "

During  this period, the affected unit can fight in one specific type of terrain (specified by the  caster) as if it were the favored terrain (per BATTLESYSTEM™ rules) for that unit.  While this spell is in effect, the unit gains no benefit when fighting in their actual favored  terrain; the magically-enforced favored terrain takes precedence. The priest can cancel  the spell before the duration expires if desired.    The material component is a pinch of clay dust.    The second effect requires preparation in advance. The priest and unit must be within  100 yards of a place of worship dedicated to the casting priest's deity. The casting time is  5 turns.    At the conclusion of the casting, the unit gains the benefit described above, with two  main differences. First, the unit does not lose the benefit of fighting in its own actual  favored terrain (the unit effectively has two favored terrains). Second, the spell endures  until the next sunset. Only priests of 12th level and higher can cast this variation.     The material component is the priest's holy symbol."

The window is  not mobile, and if the priest moves more than 5 yards away from it, it immediately  vanishes and the spell ends.    By stating a subject's name, the priest may view a specific creature or object in the  window. More than one subject may be viewed during the spell's duration. Each time a  new subject is chosen, the window becomes streaked with grey as the Astral plane flies  past. This continues for 1d4 rounds, until the window finally focuses upon the chosen  subject. If the person is not in the Astral plane, the window instead chooses a random  location.     The window operates from both sides; creatures in the Astral plane can see the priest  as easily as he can see them. Verbal communication is not possible, however.    Normally, creatures cannot pass through the window. If an attempt is made, there is a  base 5% chance of success. This is modified by +1% per level or Hit Dice of the  individual. In order to pass through, the creature or object must be small enough to fit  through the window; otherwise, only a portion of the subject may reach through (such as  a monster's arm or searching tongue).    By casting the astral window spell, a character who subsequently casts the 7th-level  astral spell may choose to arrive in the Astral plane at the place shown in the window.  "

The first are of small size  and are designed to harm foot soldiers. The latter are larger and cause serious damage to  cavalry or units composed of size L or larger creatures. Cavalry caltrops are so large that  size M or smaller creatures can easily step around them. This prevents damage to infantry  units.    Each time a unit moves into a planted area, the unit suffers an attack of AD4 (for  infantry caltrops) or AD6 (for cavalry caltrops). Units charging through a planted area  suffer double damage. If a unit ends its movement in a caltrop-sown region, it suffers another attack when it moves out of the area.    This spell can create a rectangular field of infantry caltrops up to 160 square yards in  area (e.g., 4 yards x 40 yards, 2 yards x 80 yards, etc.), or a field of cavalry caltrops up to  90 square yards in area (e.g., 3 yards x 30 yards, 2 yards x 45 yards, etc.).    Ordinary caltrops make no distinction between friend or foe; all creatures entering a  caltrop-sown area suffer the same consequences. The same is true of magical caltrops,  with one exception: the casting priest can terminate the spell at any time, causing the  caltrops to vanish and leaving the terrain clear.    Unlike normal caltrops, a region sown with magical caltrops cannot be \"swept\" clear;  the magical caltrops remain in place until the spell terminates.

The servants clear the area of debris, set up tents and bedrolls, start a campfire, fetch  water, and prepare a bland meal. The campsite is so skillfully prepared that it blends with  the surrounding terrain, reducing the chance that the camp could be noticed by 50%.  Campfires, loud noises, and other activities can negate this.   The entire process takes 4-16 (4d4) rounds to complete.    The servants make camp with the gear and equipment provided for them; otherwise,  the servants will improvise with materials available in the immediate area (50 yards of  the designated campsite). For instance, if the party has no tents or beds, the servants will  construct crude but comfortable beds of weeds and grass and temporary shelters of leaves  and branches. If no materials are available, such as in the desert or similarly barren  terrain, the servants will do their best to make the party as comfortable as possible within  the environmental limitations.    The servants cannot fight for the party, deliver messages, or take any other actions  other than creating the campsite.

The first method affects only the priest and allows him to shield his true emotions  from magical examination. Thus, it can block wizard spells such as ESP or priest spells  such as emotion read. While emotion control is in effect, anyone using one of these spells  will sense the emotion designated by the priest rather than his true emotions. When the  priest casts emotion control, he designates the false emotion he wishes to be revealed.    This use of emotion control also gives the priest a +2 bonus to saving throws against  the following spells: spook, taunt, irritation, know alignment, scare, emotion, fear, and  phantasmal killer. When any of these spells are cast on the priest, he is immediately  aware of the attempt, although he does not learn the source of the spell.    If another character casts emotion read, ESP, or a similar spell on the priest, the priest  must make a saving throw vs. spells with a +1 bonus for each 5 levels of the priest. If the  priest successfully saves, the other spellcaster reads the false emotion; if the priest fails  the saving throw, the spellcaster reads the priest's true emotion.    The second use of this spell allows the priest to create a single emotional reaction in  the subject(s) (similar to the wizard spell emotion). Some typical emotions follow, but the  DM may allow other similar effects.    Courage: The subject becomes berserk, gaining +1 to attack rolls and +3 to damage,  and temporarily gaining 4 hit points (damage against the subject is deducted from these  temporary points first). The subject need never check morale, and receives a +5 bonus to  saving throws against the various forms of fear. Courage counters (and is countered by)  fear.    Fear: The subject flees from the priest for the duration of the spell, even if this takes  him out of spell range. Fear counters (and is countered by) courage.    Friendship: The subject reacts positively to any encounter; in game terms, any result  of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table (Table 59 in the DMG ) is moved one column  to the left. Thus, a threatening PC becomes cautious, an indifferent PC becomes friendly,  etc. Friendship counters (and is countered by) hate.    Happiness: The subject experiences feelings of warmth, well-being, and confidence,  modifying all reaction rolls by +3. The subject is unlikely to attack unless provoked.  Happiness counters (and is countered by) sadness.    Hate: The subject reacts negatively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a  roll on the Encounter Reactions table is moved one column to the right (i.e., a friendly PC  becomes indifferent, a cautious PC becomes threatening, etc.). Hate counters (and is  countered by) friendship.    Hope: The subject's morale is improved by +2. His saving throw rolls, attack, and  damage rolls are all improved by +1 while this emotion is in effect. Hope counters (and is  countered by) hopelessness.    Hopelessness: The subject's morale suffers a -10 penalty. In addition, in the round in  which the emotion is initially established, all subjects must immediately make a morale  check. Hopelessness counters (and is countered by) hope.    Sadness: The subject feels uncontrollably glum and is prone to fits of morose  introspection. All attack rolls suffer a -1 penalty and initiative rolls suffer a +1 penalty.  The subject's chance of being surprised is increased by -2. Sadness counters (and is  countered by) happiness.   All subjects of the second version, even willing targets, must save vs. spell to resist  the emotion. In addition to all other modifiers, the saving throw is modified by -1 for  every three levels of the priest casting the spell.  The material component for both versions of the spell is a small bunch of fleece or  uncarded wool that is consumed in the casting.  "

If the spell is stationary, each priest must inscribe a magical sigil on parallel facing  surfaces, such as facing walls of a gatehouse or two tree trunks. If the spell is portable,  the priests must stand at each end of the line, thereby anchoring it.    After the spell is cast, a shimmering field of force appears between the two anchors  (the sigils or priests). The field is 10 feet high and sparkles with energy. Objects on the  opposite side of the translucent field, while recognizable, are hazy and indistinct.    The field causes 1d3 points of damage to all creatures passing through it; evil  creatures and undead suffer 1d8 points of damage from the field. Creatures that roll a  successful saving throw suffer no damage. Creatures that can fly over the field, burrow  under it, or teleport to the other side are immune to damage.    If the spell is cast in its portable form, the priests can move at half their movement  rates (limited to the rate of the slower priest). The priests can take no other action, since  all their energy is spent in walking and maintaining the field.    Once created, the field cannot be increased or decreased in length and must remain  straight. The priests could maneuver by pivoting, but could not walk toward each other or  bend the field around a corner. If the line of sight between the two priests is blocked by  any object of greater than 5' diameter, the spell immediately fails. Thus, creatures, low  walls, young trees, pillars, and similar objects will not disrupt the spell.    As a cooperative spell, several priests can link together to create a longer field. Each  priest (or sigil) forms the end of one field and the beginning of another, much like  fenceposts. Each section of the spell must extend in a straight line, but the field can be  bent at each junction. Four priests could form a long line, a square, or a Z pattern. The  restrictions on moving the fields apply as outlined above. The DM may apply movement  penalties depending on the complexity of the pattern.

The time required to view  a memory is one-fiftieth of the time that the actual event lasted. Thus, a priest can view  the memory of an event that lasted for one hour in a little more than one round. The  subject experiences the memory at the same time the caster reads it.    The subject must have an Intelligence score of 5 or more and must remain within  range of the priest throughout the time it takes to read the desired memory. Priests can  cast this spell on unconscious, sleeping, held, or paralyzed creatures.    The subject receives a saving throw when the priest casts the spell (this saving throw  is allowed even if the subject is asleep or otherwise unaware of the attempt). In addition, if the memory that the priest wants to view concerns something the subject wants to keep  secret, or is something that the subject is trying to suppress, the subject receives a +5  bonus to the saving throw. If the memory the priest wishes to view is more than six  months old, the subject receives a second saving throw, with bonuses depending on the  age of the memory as follows:     Age of Memory   Bonus    6-12 months      0   1 to 4 years   +1    5 years or more   +3       If the subject succeeds either of these saving throws, the spell fails.    This spell creates a mental drain on the priest, causing him to temporarily lose 1-3  points of Constitution. These can be regained only after eight hours of rest. The spell  cannot be cast again until the priest's constitution is restored.    The material component is a small piece of linen cloth with threads of gold  interspersed throughout its weave. This is consumed during the casting.  "

    "description": "This spell allows the priest to determine the \"tenor of the now\"--in other words, to  learn the \"force\" that is most dominant at the time. To cast the spell, the priest generates a  series of random numbers and then studies the pattern contained in that string of  numbers. This pattern contains information about current conditions.    In game terms, when this spell is cast, the DM communicates to the priest's player a  single word or short phrase (no more than five words) describing the \"tone\" of the  situation. Examples of suitable \"tones\" are \"imminent danger\" (the DM knows a dragon  is approaching the area); \"peace and tranquility\" (the woods in which the PCS camp may  look threatening, but the area is actually free of evil influence); or \"betrayal\" (one of the  PCS' hirelings is actually a spy of their enemy). The DM can make this comment cryptic,  but it should always be accurate and contain some useful information.    This spell has no specified area of effect. The result of moment reading will always  concern the priest and anyone else in his immediate vicinity, but the definition of  \"vicinity\" will vary depending on the circumstances. For example, the tenor of the  moment might be \"severe danger\" if the priest is entering the territory of a dragon who  attacks interlopers on sight.    The tenor of the moment is always personally applicable to the priest. For example,  even if the priest is in a nation dangerously close to war with its neighbor, this condition  will not appear in the tenor of the moment unless the priest is personally involved (if he's  currently in the direct path of an invading army, for instance).    One casting of this spell tends to \"taint\" subsequent castings of the same spell unless  they are separated by a minimum length of time. If a priest casts this spell twice within 12  hours, the second reading gives the same result as the first, regardless of the actual  situation. If a second priest casts the spell within 12 hours of another priest's use of the  spell, he receives an accurate reading.     The material component is a set of 36 small disks made of polished bone engraved  with runes that represent numbers. These disks are not consumed in the casting.  "

Instead, the person  wielding the weapon or one of his companions suffers the damage. If the weapon misses  its target on any round, no damage is caused in that round.    Using a die roll, the DM randomly determines the victim of the damage. The DM  selects a die with a value nearest the number of eligible creatures (the wielder of the  weapon and his companions). If the number of creatures does not equate to highest value  of a die, the wielder of the enchanted weapon takes the extra chances to be hit. For  example, if a goblin wields a sword affected by this spell, he and his six companions are  eligible to receive the damage. The DM rolls 1d8. On a roll of 1-6, one of the goblin's  companions suffers the damage; on a roll of 7 or 8, the goblin with the affected weapon  suffers the damage.    The weapon is affected for 3 rounds+1 round/level of the spell caster. If the wielder  of the weapon changes weapons while the spell is in effect, the discarded weapon  remains enchanted.

Telepathy does not give either participant access to the other's thoughts, memories, or  emotions.

Balfas can communicate a single  thought to both Alra and Zymor, but Alra and Zymor cannot communicate with each  other.

The result is that the priest may cast another spell that affects the subject individual  at a range much greater than normal. In other words, by gaining deep knowledge of the  individual, the priest creates a \"channel\" to that individual that makes a subsequent spell  easier to cast on that subject.

A spell to be enhanced by telethaumaturgy must be cast on the round immediately  following the completion of telethaumaturgy. Spells that normally affect more than one  individual (such as confusion ) will affect only the selected subject when cast following  telethaumaturgy.    When telethaumaturgy is cast by a priest of 11th level or higher, it has an additional  effect. If the target is within the normal range of the subsequent spell (e.g., 80 yards for  charm person), the subject's saving throw suffers a penalty of -2.

If the priest casts the spell using an alias, he will not  know that telethaumaturgy has not taken effect until the subsequent spell fails.

Thus a 10th-level priest may bind the spirit of an individual who was dead for up to a turn. If successful, the spirit bound corpse takes on a pale silvery or mauve radiance. Normal animals and even monsters of low intelligence will involuntarily shun this necromantic aura. While under the effect of this spell, a cadaver becomes immune to the normal effects of rot and decay. Spirit bind may thus be employed to preserve a body for a subsequent raising or resurrection, for which the spirit bound individual is considered to have been dead for less than a day. Furthermore, because of the strong, necromantic link already forged between the spirit and the body, the victim receives a -10% bonus on his or her system shock roll. However, this spell is more often put to much darker ends by death priests. Note that, for the deceased, being spirit bound is not a pleasant experience. The spirit may not be aware of its current location or the passage of time (or so good-aligned priests who employ this spell may like to think), but it is most certainly aware of being trapped or constrained. Once bound to its body, a spirit is much easier to coerce with threats of permanent imprisonment and to interrogate with speak with dead spells. Some sages speculate spirit bind may be also involved in the loathsome creation of a flesh golem. While immune to normal decay and dissolution (and the ravaging of animals and dumb monsters), the spirit bound corpse is in no way protected from destruction by a sentient creature or individual. Should its body be destroyed, the spirit instead becomes bound to the last area resided by the physical remains. Such a restless, quasi-liberated spirit might become a non-corporeal undead (such as an apparition, banshee, haunt, poltergeist, wraith, ghost, or spectre). A spirit imprisoned in this manner may only be released by casting the reverse of this spell (see below) or dispel evil (dispel magic and reverse curse arc ineffective). Because of the considerable dangers for the subject and moral quandaries involved, good-aligned priests arc naturally reluctant to employ spirit bind except in the most dire emergencies. The reverse of this spell, spirit release, severs a spirits ties with the material world and is a common practice at formal funerals. Unwilling, non-corporeal undead are entitled to a saving throw to resist the spell's effects, subject to the same penalties as outlined for spirit bind. If failed, the undead spirit departs for the outer planes and is effectively dispersed. Note that neither version of this spell affects corporeal undead (such as ghouls, liches, and vampires), nor do they affect extraplanar creatures."

The spell fails against entities of demigod status or greater, but their servants or minions can be abjured. If the creature has a specific (proper) name, it must be known and used. Any magic resistance of the subject must be overcome, or the spell fails. The priest has a 50% chance of success (a roll of 11 or better on 1d20). The roll is adjusted by the difference in level or Hit Dice between the caster and the creature being abjured; the number needed is decreased if the priest has more Hit Dice and increased if the creature has more Hit Dice. If the spell is successful, the creature is instantly hurled back to its own plane. The affected creature must survive a system shock check. If the creature does not have a Constitution score, the required roll is 70% + 2%/Hit Die or level. The caster has no control over where in the creature's plane the abjured creature arrives. If the attempt fails, the priest must gain another level before another attempt can be made on that particular creature.

Naturally, this spell works only outdoors, but not necessarily only in wooded areas. The caster begins the incantation and continues uninterrupted until some called creature appears or two turns have elapsed. (The verbalization and somatic gesturing are easy, so this is not particularly exhausting to the spellcaster.) Only one type of the following sorts of beings can be summoned by the spell. They come only if they are within the range of the call. The caster can call three times, for a different type each time. Once a call is successful, no other type can be called without another casting of the spell. (The DM will consult his outdoor map or base the probability of any such creature being within spell range upon the nature of the area the caster is in at the time of spellcasting.) The creature(s) called by the spell are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell (with a -4 penalty) to avoid the summons. Any woodland beings answering the call are favorably disposed to the spellcaster and give whatever aid they are capable of. However, if the caller or members of the caller's party are of evil alignment, the creatures are entitled to another saving throw vs. spell (this time with a +4 bonus) when they come within 10 yards of the caster or another evil character with him. These beings immediately seek to escape if their saving throws are successful. In any event, if the caster requests that the summoned creatures engage in combat on his behalf, they are required to roll a loyalty reaction check based on the caster's Charisma and whatever dealings he has had with them. This spell works with respect to neutral or good woodland creatures, as determined by the DM. Thus, the DM can freely add to or alter the list as he sees fit. If the caster personally knows a certain individual woodland being, that being can be summoned at double the normal range. If this is done, no other woodland creatures are affected. If a percentage chance is given in the accompanying table, druids and other nature- based priests add 1% per caster level. These chances can be used if no other campaign information on the area is available. The material components of this spell are a pine cone and eight holly berries.

This can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. Unlike the augury spell, this gives a specific piece of advice. For example, if the question is \"Will we do well if we venture to the third level?\" and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the level (the DM estimates the party could beat the troll after a hard fight), the divination response might be: \"Ready oil and open flame light your way to wealth.\" In all cases, the DM controls what information is received and whether additional divinations will supply additional information. Note that if the information is not acted upon, the conditions probably change so that the information is no longer useful (in the example, the troll might move away and take the treasure with it). The base chance for a correct divination is 60%, plus 1% for each experience level of the priest casting the spell. The DM makes adjustments to this base chance considering the actions being divined (if, for example, unusual precautions against the spell have been taken). If the dice roll is failed, the caster knows the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work. The material components of the divination spell are a sacrificial offering, incense, and the holy symbol of the priest. If an unusually important divination is attempted, sacrifice of particularly valuable gems, jewelry, or magical items may be required."

Only one type of insect can be altered at one time (i.e., a single casting cannot affect both an ant and a fly) and all insects affected must be grown to the same size. The number of insects and the size to which they can be grown depends upon the priest's level: Priest's    Insect Maximum Level Hit Dice Total HD   7-9     3      9 10-12     4    12  13+     6    15 For example, an 8th-level priest can grow three insects to 3 Hit Dice, four insects to 2 Hit Dice, or nine insects to 1 Hit Die. Flying insects of 3 Hit Dice or more can carry a rider of human size (assume that such can carry 80 pounds per Hit Die). If the casting is interrupted for any reason, or if the insects are currently subject to any other magical effect (including this one), the insects die and the spell is ruined. The DM decides how many normal insects of what type are available; this is often a greater limitation on the spell than the limits above. If the insect created by this spell matches an existing monster description, use the monster description. Otherwise, unless the DM creates a special description, the giant form has an Armor Class of between 8 and 4, one attack, and inflicts 1d4 points of damage per Hit Die. For example, a 14th-level priest uses the giant insect spell to enlarge one beetle (all that is available) to 6 HD size. The DM decides the beetle has AC 5 and bites once for 6d4 points of damage. Note that the spell works only on actual insects. Arachnids, crustaceans, and other types of small creatures are not affected. Any giant insects created by this spell do not attempt to harm the priest, but the priest's control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (\"attack,\" \"defend,\" \"guard,\" and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex. Unlesscommanded to do otherwise, the giant insects attempt to attack whoever or whatever is near them. The reverse of the spell, shrink insect, reduces any giant insect to normal insect size. The number of Hit Dice affected by the priest is subtracted from the number of Hit Dice of the insects, and any insect reduced to 0 Hit Dice has been shrunk. Partial shrinking is ignored; an insect is either shrunk or unaffected. Thus, a 9th-level priest attacked by giant ants could shrink three warrior ants or four worker ants to normal insect size with no saving throw. This spell has no effect on intelligent insectlike creatures. The priest must use his holy symbol for either version of the spell."

The scrying can extend only to the Ethereal Plane and the Inner Planes (which includes the paraelemental planes, the Demiplane of Shadow, etc.). General notes on scrying, detection by the subject, and penalties for attempting to scry beyond the caster's own plane are given in the DMG, as well as a description of the crystal ball item. The following spells can be cast through a reflecting pool, with a 5% per level chance for operating correctly: detect magic, detect snares and pits, and detect poison.

These snakes attack as commanded by the priest. There must, of course, be sticks or similar pieces of wood (such as torches, spears, etc.) to turn into snakes. Such a stick cannot be larger than a staff. Sticks held by creatures are allowed a saving throw equal to that of the possessor (i.e., a spear held by an orc must roll the orc's saving throw vs. polymorph). Magical items, such as staves and enchanted spears, are not affected by the spell. Only sticks within the area of effect are changed. The type of snake created varies, but a typical specimen has 2 Hit Dice, Armor Class 6, a movement rate of 9, and either constricts for 1d4+1 points of damage per round or bites for 1 point plus poison (if any). The chance of a snake thus changed being venomous is 5% per caster level, if the spellcaster desires. Thus, an 11th-level priest has a maximum 55% chance that any snake created by the spell is poisonous. The spell lasts for two rounds for each experience level of the spellcaster. The material components of the spell are a small piece of bark and several snake scales. The reverse spell changes normal-sized snakes to sticks for the same duration, or it negates the sticks to snakes spell according to the level of the priest countering the spell (for example, a 10th-level priest casting the reverse spell can turn 11-14 snakes back into sticks)."

Like fortify, entrench may be used to  prepare an open outdoors area such as a field or grassland, or a rough outdoors area such  as a hillside or forest. Large rooms or chambers may be entrenched as well. In addition to  the ditches and ramparts of the fortify spell, entrench makes use of local materials to  create a small palisade and an array of stakes or sharp stones to discourage attackers.    A. Open Outdoors Site: A rampart or dike of earth faced by a staked ditch rises  from the ground along the perimeter of the site. Creatures defending the dike receive 75%  cover against missile fire (+7 bonus to AC), or 25% cover (+2 bonus) if they expose  themselves by engaging in melee combat or firing missiles out of the dike. Attackers  cannot charge, run, or sprint over the rampart, and must spend one full round negotiating  the defenses in order to attack. The dike’s defenders receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls  against any creatures trying to move through the stakes or stones.    B. Rough Outdoors Site: Loose stones, deadwood, and briars are arranged to  form a defensible wall along the perimeter of the area of effect, faced by an array of sharp  stakes or stones. Characters hiding behind the wall receive 90% cover (+10 bonus to AC),  or 50% cover (+4 bonus) if they expose themselves by firing missiles or defending the  wall. Attacking creatures cannot run, charge, or sprint through the defenses, and must  spend one full round to get through the stakes plus an additional round climbing over the  wall in order to enter the fortified area. The wall’s defenders gain a +1 bonus to attacks  against creatures negotiating the defenses.    C. Marshy or Low-lying Site: In swamps or bogs, entrench creates a water-filled  ditch around the perimeter of the area of effect. This ditch is 15 feet wide and 3 to 6 feet  deep; most creatures require two full rounds to negotiate the ditch and climb up the far  side, and defenders gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies who are wading the  ditch or climbing up the other side.    The fortifications created by this spell are permanent, although erosion,     weathering, and clearing or filling can return the site to its original state. The material  component is the shell of a giant nautilus. In the Battlesystem rules, entrench provides the  defending units with a +3 bonus to their AR versus missile and melee attacks, but only a  +1 bonus against missile attacks in marshy areas. "

    "description": "By using this spell, the caster can place one willing subject in a state of suspended  animation. The victim’s breathing, heartbeat, and other vital processes slow to the point  of nonexistence, although he or she seems to be deeply asleep, not dead. A caster of 7th  to 10th level can maintain the suspended animation for up to one week plus one day per  level; a caster of 11th to 15th level can maintain the state for up to one month plus one  week per level; and a caster of 16th level or higher can place someone in suspended  animation for one year plus one month per level.    This spell has many useful applications. First, all bodily or mental afflictions  become quiescent during the victim’s slumber. Poison, insanity, and many curses  (lycanthropy, geas, and mummy rot included) can be arrested, if not cured, and have no  effect on the subject while he sleeps. Of course, if the spell is broken prematurely, all the  conditions that were halted by the spell will start once again. Second, the subject requires  no food or water, but he still needs air and dies if deprived of oxygen. Third, for every  month that the subject is in suspended animation, he recovers one hit point.    The caster can awaken the subject at any time within the spell’s duration,  although he must be in the subject’s presence to do so. Optionally, the priest may  pre-specify an amount of time within his normal duration or a special condition to  awaken the sleeper. A condition must include a physical stimulus to the subject, such as a  change in temperature, the touch of the sun, the kiss of a princess, or whatever the priest  desires. If the priest maintaining the spell dies or is not able to awaken the sleeper, then  the subject can be taken to another priest of the same deity to be awakened.    If the subject is attacked, he is completely helpless and can be killed by a single  blow. However, if the subject is attacked without being slain for some reason, he gains a  saving throw vs. spell each round to emerge from his suspended animation. The subject  will be extremely groggy and disoriented if his slumber is disturbed in this fashion,  suffering a –2 penalty to all die rolls for 1d6 turns, but if he awakens in the normal or     prescribed fashion, he is disoriented for only one round.    Some of the drawbacks to this spell affect the casting priest. First of all, it takes  all of the priest’s concentration to cast and maintain this spell. This means that the priest  cannot cast any other spell while a subject is being held under the influence of the  suspended animation. For each week that the subject is in suspended animation, the priest  loses one point of Constitution. This happens each week until the priest transfers the spell  to another priest of the same alignment. Transferring this spell requires a successful  saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, then the priest who transfers the  spell can start recovering Constitution at a rate of one point per hour of bedrest. If the  saving throw doesn’t succeed, then the priest loses another point of Constitution and  cannot try to transfer the spell again for 8 hours. Either way, because of the temporary  lapse of the spell, the subject will automatically lose 1 hit point each time a transfer is  attempted.    The material component for this spell is a rare herb that must be prepared with  exacting care. The treatment costs at least 200 gold pieces and requires 1d3 days of the  priest’s time and attention.

If windborne is cast by a priest on level ground, the initial gust carries him aloft to  a maximum altitude of 10 feet per caster level. From that point, he may then glide 10 feet  per foot of initial altitude. For example, a 7th-level priest would ascend to an altitude of  70 feet and thus be able to glide for a total horizontal distance of 700 feet. He can choose  to glide for a much shorter distance, but never less than his initial altitude.    While gliding, the priest moves at a rate of 15 (or about 450 feet) with a  maneuverability class of D. Each round, he drops between 20 and 40 feet. He can choose  to descend at a much more rapid pace, dropping up to 200 feet per round without risk of a  damaging impact upon landing. The caster doesn’t gain a mastery of aerial combat with  this spell and suffers a –2 penalty to his attack rolls and Armor Class if he becomes  involved in combat while gliding.

    "description": "The philosophy of the Sphere of Numbers holds that the structure of reality--the  \"equation of the moment\"--can be analyzed and modified by someone with sufficient  knowledge and power. The addition spell allows a priest to add a new mathematical term  to the equation of the moment. This effectively allows a new object or even a living  creature to be brought into existence temporarily.    The effect of this spell varies depending on the level of the caster. At 10th level or  lower, addition can create a single, inanimate object weighing up to 10 pounds. The spell  gives the priest only rudimentary control over the creation process, so the object cannot  be complex. The object must be described in a single word or short phrase (e.g., \"a water  pitcher\" or \"a block of stone\"). The caster has no control over elements such as shape or  color; thus, the water pitcher might be short, squat, and blue, or tall, slender, and red.    Objects created with this spell cannot be of any greater mechanical complexity or  technological level than a crossbow. If the priest tries to create an object that breaks this  prohibition, the spell fails and nothing is created. Thus, if the priest tried to create \"a  pistol,\" assuming he had heard the word somewhere, the spell would fail.    Objects cannot contain any information in an abstract form such as writing or  diagrams. If the priest tries to create an object that breaks this prohibition, there are two  possible results: the spell may fail, or the object may be created without the information. Thus, if the priest were to attempt to create \"a spellbook,\" the result would be either a  book similar to a spellbook with blank pages, or nothing at all.    The object appears at whatever location the caster wills, as long as it is within spell  range. The object cannot appear in the same space occupied by another object or creature,  or within a hollow object (for example, the priest cannot create an object blocking the  trachea of an enemy).    The object created by addition remains in existence for 1 turn per level of the caster.  During this time, it obeys all the laws of physics as if it were a \"real\" object. The object  cannot be disbelieved and spells such as true seeing cannot distinguish it from a  naturally-occurring object.    Priests of 11th to 15th level can create a single inanimate object of up to 20 pounds in  mass or two identical objects, each of up to five pounds in mass. The object(s) so created  remains in existence for two hours (12 turns) per level of the caster.     Priests of 16th to 19th level can create a single inanimate object of up to 50 pounds in  mass or up to 10 identical objects, each of up to five pounds in mass. The object(s) is  permanent unless destroyed. Since these objects are not magical constructs, but real  additions to the \"equation of the moment,\" dispel magic has no effect on them.  Alternatively, the caster can create a single normal (nonmonstrous) living creature of up  to 20 pounds in weight. The creature, once created, behaves as a normal member of its  species; the caster has no control over its actions. This creature remains in existence for 5  rounds per level of the caster.    Priests of 20th level and above can create a single inanimate object of up to 100  pounds in mass or up to 10 identical objects, each of up to 10 pounds in mass. The  object(s) are permanent. Alternatively, the caster can create a single normal  (nonmonstrous) living creature of up to 100 pounds in weight and up to 2 hit dice. The  creature, once created, behaves as a normal member of its species; the caster has no  control over its actions. This creature remains in existence for 2 turns per level of the  caster.    The material component is a small table of numerological formulae inscribed on an  ivory plaque, plus a length of silken cord. During the casting, the priest ties the cord into  a complex knot. As the magical energy is discharged, the cord vanishes in a flash of light.  The plaque is not consumed in the casting.  "

If the saving throw is failed, the  spell takes effect at the next sunrise or sunset (whichever comes first).    From the time the spell takes effect until the spell is negated, the sleeping pattern of  the victim is randomly disrupted. At sunset and sunrise of every day, a check is made to  determine the effects of chaotic sleep. In the 12-hour period that follows the check, there is an equal chance that the character will be unable to sleep or unable to remain awake  (roll 1d6; on a roll of 1-3, the character is awake, on a roll of 4-6, he sleeps). This  condition lasts until the next sunrise (or sunset) when the check is made again.    For example, a fighter fails to save against chaotic sleep. For the next few hours, the  spell has no effect. At sundown, the first check is made, resulting in a 2. The fighter does  not notice anything until he tries to sleep that night, at which time he is wide awake,  fidgeting and restless. At sunrise, another die roll is made, resulting in a 6. The fighter is  suddenly exhausted and sleeps until sunset.    Characters who sleep as a result of this spell can be roused only by physical stimuli--a  slap or a wound, for example. Once awake, the character remains conscious only as long  as there are active stimuli around him, such as a fight. Walking through caves or riding a  horse will not keep the character awake. Unlike a sleep spell, characters affected by  chaotic sleep doze off as soon as they are left relatively undisturbed. Keeping an affected  character awake is difficult at best.    Lack of sleep will eventually take a physical toll on any character under the influence  of the spell. For every 12-hour period that a character remains awake beyond the first, he  suffers a -1 penalty to THAC0. Such characters do not regain hit points as a result of  normal healing. Spellcasters cannot memorize spells until they have had sufficient sleep.    Chaotic sleep can be removed with a remove curse.    The material components are a pinch of sand and three coffee beans.

If he discovers treasure, he divides it into tidy piles or containers of silver,  gold, and copper. He is reluctant to enter a dungeon because it is a messy place, but once  inside, he is obsessed with cleaning it. A character under the power of this spell will  sweep dirt from dungeon corridors into neat piles, arrange the corpses of a defeated orc  band according to size, dash forward to remove a bit of lint on clothing, and insist that the  party organize themselves alphabetically, then by size, and then by age. While the spell  does not affect a character's abilities, the overwhelming desire for order impairs the  character's usefulness in most adventures.    When a character afflicted by this spell attempts to undertake a new event (begin a  battle, haggle with the merchant, etc.), the player must rationalize the action on the basis  of his compulsion for order. Thus, the character cannot simply attack a goblin; he must  announce a condition such as attacking the tallest goblin and fighting his way down  according to size. Once stated, the character must follow through with this plan.    If the player cannot conceive a rationale for his character's behavior, the character is  forced to delay his actions for 1d6 rounds, with the time spent in preparation for the  subsequent action. The character spends time arranging spell components artistically,  deciding how to hold his sword, cleaning his weapon, etc.    Anyone affected by compulsive order may become violent if he is prevented from  being neat. He will do what he must to make the world around him more orderly. If he is  allowed to organize his surroundings, he will quickly calm down again.

Defensive harmony grants affected creatures a defensive bonus by bestowing an  enhanced coordination of their attacks and defenses. The affected creatures must be  involved in a single battle so that their efforts harmonize to the benefit of all involved.  For example, the affected creatures can attack one dragon or a group of orcs in a single  area. They can also attack additional enemy forces that arrive in the same combat. If the enemy forces divide and flee, the affected creatures can follow, continue to attack, and  benefit from the spell. If the affected group is split into two smaller groups when  attacked, however, it gains no benefit from defensive harmony.    While the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +1 bonus to armor class for  every other creature benefitting from the spell, to a maximum bonus of +5 (although  more than five characters may be affected by the spell). Thus, if four creatures are  affected by defensive harmony, each creature gains a +3 bonus to armor class.

    "description": "This spell allows the caster to selectively warp the fabric of space, folding it into  higher dimensions.    This effect can be best explained through an example. If an ant crawling along the  west edge of a map decided to travel to the east edge of the map, it would have to crawl  the full width of the map. But if the map were folded in two so that the east and west  edges were touching, the ant would travel almost no distance at all. The ant's world (the  map) would have been folded through the third dimension. The dimensional folding spell  does something similar with the three-dimensional world: it folds it through a higher  dimension (the fourth), allowing instantaneous travel between two locales on the same  plane of existence.    Although this effect may seem similar to the wizard spell teleport, in practice, it is  much different. The dimensional folding spell opens a gate that allows instantaneous,  bidirectional access to a distant locale on the same plane. This gate is circular, of any size  up to 10' in diameter, and remains in existence for up to 1 full round. The caster and any  other creatures can pass through the gate in either direction while it remains open. Missile  weapons and magic spells can also pass through the gate.    The gate appears as a shimmering ring, glowing with a faint light equivalent to  starshine. Vision through the gate is clear and unobstructed in both directions, allowing  the priest to \"look before he leaps.\" However, anyone on the other side of the gate is able  to see the priest and his point of origin.    The \"near side\" of the gate always appears within 5 feet of the priest. The location of  the \"far side\" of the gate always opens within 5 feet of the place the priest desires. Thus,  there is no chance of arriving at the wrong destination, as with the wizard spell teleport.    There is a risk involved in using dimensional folding, however. Many philosophers believe that what we know as time is simply another dimension, and the behavior of this  spell seems to support this thesis. Unless the priest is extremely familiar with the  destination, there is a significant chance that any creature passing through a dimensional  folding gate will suffer instantaneous aging. Theorists believe that this is the same kind of  \"slippage\" that can cause a teleporting wizard to land high or low, except that in this case,  the slippage is in the time dimension.    The chance of this instantaneous aging occurring depends on how familiar the priest  is with the destination. The table that follows outlines the conditions and effects of aging.      Chance of   Amount of    Destination is:   aging   aging    Very familiar*     2%   1 year    Studied carefully     5%   1d2 years    Seen casually   10%   1d3 years    Viewed once   15%   1d6 years    Never seen   25%   1d10 years     * Use this row if the desired location is within view of  the priest.      If the die roll indicates that aging occurs, every creature that passes through the gate  in either direction suffers the aging effect. Multiple creatures passing through the gate in  the same direction all age by the same amount determined by a single die roll. Although  the chance of aging is low and the potential amount of aging is minimal for familiar  destinations, the effects can add up and become significant over time.    Although the word \"destination\" is used to refer to the \"far end\" of the gate, the priest  need not be the one doing the traveling. For example, a priest may open the gate near a  distant ally so he may travel instantaneously to join the priest.    The material component is a sheet of platinum \"tissue\" worth at least 15 gp, which the  priest folds intricately during the casting. The tissue is consumed when the gate closes.  "

    "description": "This spell creates the necessary conditions for devotional energy to be used. For faith  magic to work, the priest must create a focus to harness the necessary devotional energy.  This spell creates that focus. A focus cannot function without a source of devotional  energy.    The focus gathers devotional energy and reshapes it in order to amplify other spells  cast by the priest (or priests). The same energy keeps the focus in existence. If the spell is  cast and there is no immediate source of devotional energy within 100 feet, the focus  immediately fails.    Once created, most foci cannot be moved. This condition and the need for a constant  supply of devotional energy tends to limit the use of foci to temples, churches,  monasteries, shrines, and seminaries--permanent structures where followers of the  religion gather on a regular basis. Sometimes a focus is created for a special gathering  such as a holy day, conclave, grand wedding, or yearly festival.    Not all foci are identical. The particular form of the focus depends on the power and  nature of the spell being amplified. All foci can be seen by detect magic. There are three  basic types of foci: site, item, and living.    Site foci are connected to a place, whether a room, building, field, or forest. Once  cast, the foci cannot be moved. It causes no disturbance in the surroundings; it is invisible  and intangible.    Item foci are centered on a single object. Customarily, this object is large and  immovable, such as an altar, but it is possible for the focus to be as small as is practical.  The item can be as elaborate or plain as desired, but should have some significance to the  religion.    Living foci are the rarest of all types. In this case, the focus is created on a living  plant, animal, or person. Detect charm reveals the person is somehow enchanted,  although not under the influence of a typical charm spell.    The type of focus created (site, item, or living) depends on the religion and nature of  the spell amplified. These choices are listed in Table 3: Focused Spell Effects.    Casting the focus spell is a long and complicated process, accompanied by many ceremonies and rituals. During the day spent casting the spell, the priest will need the  assistance of at least two other priests of the same faith. These aides need not memorize  the spell (or even be capable of casting it). Their duty is to provide the extra hands and  voices needed at specific points of the casting. A large number of worshipers must also  be present since the focus requires their energy. Not surprisingly, the casting of this spell  is often incorporated into important holy festivals or special occasions.    The duration of the focus is one year. If the devotional energy falls below a minimum  level, the spell ends sooner. A focus requires the devotional energy of at least 100 devout  worshipers. Lay monks (those dedicated to the religion but not priests) count as two  worshipers, while priests (of any level) count as ten. A focus could be maintained by a  congregation of 100, a monastery of fifty, or a seminary of as few as 10 priests (or any  combination of the above). The focus must receive this energy for at least 10 hours out of  every day. If these conditions are not met, the focus weakens. The area of effect of the  amplified spell decreases by 20% each day until it fades away completely.    Once the focus is created, the priest or priests have 1 turn in which to cast the desired  spell upon the focus. A focus can amplify only one spell, and each item, creature, or place  can receive only one focus. Spells that can be cast upon a focus are listed on Table 3.     Table 3: FOCUSED SPELL EFFECTS           Possible Focus    Spell  Type    Anti-animal shell   S/I/L    Anti-plant shell   S/I/L    Bless   S/I    Control temperature, 10' radius   S*    Control winds   S/I*    Cure disease   I/L    Cure blindness or deafness   I/L    Detect poison   S/I    Detect lie   I    Detect magic   I    Dispel evil   S/I    Endure cold/endure heat   S*    Know alignment   I/L    Negative plane protection   S/I    Protection from evil   S/I    Protection from lightning   S    Protections from fire   S    Purify food and drink   I    Remove fear   S/I/L    Remove curse   I    Repel insects   S/I    Resist fire/resist cold   S    Speak with animals   S/I/L    Tongues   S/I    True seeing   S       * The caster must state a desired range (temperature, wind strength, etc.) within the  spell's normal limitations at the time it is cast.      Once the spell is cast, the normal duration and area of effect for that spell are ignored.  The focus begins to increase these factors of the spell's power. After one day, the  amplified spell reaches its full area of effect. Thereafter, it remains over that area until the  focus fails.    The area affected by the focus (and its amplified spell) depends on the level of the  caster. The spell expands in a radius from the focus, 20 feet per level of the caster,  although it can deliberately be created smaller. Within that area of effect, the amplified  spell exerts its normal effect. A 13th-level priest could create a focus up to 260 feet in  diameter.    The material components are many, including special vestments, incense, oils, waters,  and other equipment the DM deems appropriate. The cost of these materials is never less  than 1,000 gp plus 100 gp per level of spell being amplified. These items are given up as  offerings to the deity (perhaps to be distributed to the poor), and new ones must be  obtained each time the spell is cast.  "

The priest casting fortify must lay his hand  on the priest attempting the cure. When both spells are cast, additional energy flows  through the second priest and into the creature being healed. Fortify automatically causes  the cure spell to function at maximum effect. Thus, a cure serious wounds would  automatically heal 17 points of damage and a cure critical wounds would heal 27 points  of damage.    The material component is the priest's holy symbol.  "

While under the  influence of this spell, a creature behaves in a manner opposite to the way he normally  would behave. Thus, a shopkeeper influenced by inverted ethics will think it perfectly  normal for someone to pick up an item from his shop and walk out the door without  paying for it. If someone tried to pay for an item, he would be insulted. If the spell is cast  on a shopper in a store, he would find it natural to steal the item, thinking that he is  behaving in a proper way. If the spell is cast on a professed thief, he will no longer steal,  choosing to pay for his goods instead.    Inverted ethics does not cause a creature to actively commit evil deeds (or good  deeds). Thus, an affected creature will not go on a shoplifting rampage; he will steal only  as the opportunity presents itself.    The spell affects one character per level of the caster within a 20' radius. Each target  of the spell is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect.

The  priest can cast the spell on any single individual (a commander or hero) within his line of  sight.    While under the influence of this spell, the subject's command radius is increased by  50% (round fractions up).

The second variation must take place in or within 100' of a place of worship officially  dedicated to the casting priest's deity. Both the priest and the individual to be affected  must be present. The casting time is 5 turns and involves an intricate ritual and many  prayers. At the conclusion of the spell, the subject's command radius is doubled. This  effect lasts 2d12 hours.    The priest can cast either aspect (but not both at once) on himself. No individual can  be the subject of more than one casting of this spell at one time, whether different aspects  or cast by different priests. If more than one spell is attempted on the individual, only the  most recent casting takes effect.  "

There are some significant differences between the spells, however.    Elves and half-elves have no innate resistance to this spell. Priest and subject need not  share a common language. The priest can force the subject into combat, but the subject's  attack rolls suffer a -2 penalty. The priest cannot force the subject to cast spells or use any  innate magical or magiclike abilities. The priest can force the subject to speak, although  the priest cannot inject a full range of emotions into the subject's voice (everything said  by the subject is in a monotone).    This spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory  apparatus. Thus, the priest cannot see through the subject's eyes. To control the subject,  the priest must be within the range of the spell and must be able to see the subject.  Breaking either of these conditions causes the spell to terminate immediately.    This spell requires a moderate level of concentration by the priest. While maintaining  this spell, he can move or enter combat, but cannot cast another spell. If the priest is  wounded, rendered unconscious, or killed, the spell immediately terminates.    If the priest is 10th level or lower, he or she cannot force the subject to perform  particularly delicate actions, such as picking a lock. At 11th level or higher, however, this  restriction is removed. The priest could thus force a thief to pick a lock. Any such  delicate actions suffer a -15% penalty (or -3 on 1d20) to reflect the \"remote control\"  nature of the action.    The material component is a mesh of fine threads that the priest loops around the  fingertips of one hand and manipulates in the way that a puppeteer controls a puppet.  "

    "description": "This spell enables the caster to reach into the subject's mind and modify up to five  minutes of his memory in one of the following ways:    •Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This spell cannot  negate charm, suggestion, geas, quest, or similar spells.   •Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event he actually experienced. For  instance, he could recall every word from a five-minute conversation or every detail from  a passage in a book.    •Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.    •Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.

If the caster's concentration is disturbed before the visualization  is complete, the spell is lost.    Modified memory will not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if they  contradict his natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory, such as the subject  recalling how much he enjoyed drinking poison, will be dismissed by the subject as a bad  dream or a memory muddied by too much wine. More useful applications of modified  memory include implanting memories of friendly encounters with the caster (inclining the  subject to act favorably toward the caster), changing the details of orders given to the  subject by a superior, or causing the subject to forget that the caster cheated him in a card  game. The DM reserves the right to decide whether a modified memory is too nonsensical  to significantly affect the subject.  "

    "description": "This spell allows the priest to increase or decrease by a small margin the probability  of success for one action. This action can be anything that requires a die roll--an attack, a  saving throw, an attempt to use thieving skills, an ability check, or even an attempt to  successfully teleport on target. The action must be something performed by a single  creature.    The basic modification is 15% (15 on 1d100 or 3 on 1d20), plus an additional 5% per  five levels of the caster. This modification can be either positive or negative, as deemed  by the spellcaster. Thus, a 10th-level priest can modify a subject's saving throw or attack  roll by +5 or -5, or a thief's \"climb walls\" roll by +25% or -25%. The priest may cast this  spell on himself.    For a noncombat action such as an attempt to climb a wall, the priest simply casts the  spell on the subject immediately before the action is attempted, informing the DM  whether the modification is positive or negative. To use this spell in combat, the priest  must specify the action to be affected (e.g., the target's next attack roll) and whether the  modification will be positive or negative. The spell remains in effect until the subject  attempts the specified action or until a number of rounds equal to the caster's level passes.  If the latter occurs, the spell ends without effect.    Once the spell is cast, the priest does not need to maintain any level of concentration; the spell will function even if the casting priest is killed before the spell takes effect.    The subject of the spell has no way of knowing whether any modification made by  this spell is positive or negative (or even whether he was the subject of the spell at all).  Thus, a lying priest could claim to raise a thief's chance of climbing the wall, while  actually lowering it. The thief would be none the wiser. However, an unwilling subject of  this spell receives a normal saving throw to negate its effect.    The material components are a small cube of a thickened sugar-and-milk mixture and  a cubic die of matching size. Both are consumed in the casting.  "

Participants may share  deeper thoughts than with telepathy, including emotions and memories. Each participant  sees, hears, and otherwise senses everything experienced by the other, although such  vicarious experiences feel diluted and cannot be mistaken for direct sensations.    The participants can quickly share such personal concepts as plans, hopes, and fears,  but they cannot share skills or spells. Thus, it is impossible to communicate the procedure  for casting a particular spell or for picking a lock.    Communication through rapport is approximately 15 times faster than verbal  communication. As with telepathy, the priest can establish separate \"channels\" to  multiple individuals; each such linkage costs one casting of the spell. There is no  \"crosstalk\" between the channels, however.    Rapport cannot be used on unwilling subjects.  "

    "description": "This unusual spell is similar to phantasmal force and other illusion magic, except that  the priest who casts the spell is the only creature who automatically believes the results of  the spell. The spell creates the illusion of any object, creature, or force, as long as it is  within the boundaries of the spell's area of effect. The illusion is visual and tactile (that is,  it can be seen and felt), but no other sensory stimuli are created.   Solipsism is the opposite of normal illusions in that anyone other than the caster must  make an active effort to believe (rather than dis believe) the illusion. Characters trying to  believe the reality of a solipsistic illusion must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon,  modified by the magical defense adjustment for Wisdom. A successful save means that  the character believes the illusion and it is part of reality for him. A failed save means  that the character cannot convince himself of the illusion's reality, and the illusion has no  effect on him. A character can make a single attempt to believe each round.    Unlike true illusions, the image created by this spell does more than just duplicate  reality. The image formed is real for those who believe in it. The illusion has all the  normal properties that its form and function allow. Thus, a solipsistic bridge spanning a  chasm could be crossed by the priest and those who believed. All others would see the  priest apparently walking out onto nothingness. Likewise, a solipsistic giant would cause  real damage to those who believed it.    The illusion remains in effect for as long as the priest continues to concentrate on it,  until the priest is struck in combat, or until he is rendered  unconscious. The level of  concentration required is not extreme; the priest can move normally and may engage in  combat, but is unable to cast any spell while maintaining a solipsistic illusion.    Solipsism can create only illusions that are external to the priest. Thus, the priest  cannot create an illusion that he is the size of a giant, is unwounded, or has sprouted  wings.    The material components are a lotus blossom that the priest must swallow and a bit of  fleece.  "

Everyone who senses these  thoughts, on the other hand, knows their source.    This spell causes the broadcast of only surface thoughts and motivations, not  memories. There is no need for a common language between broadcaster and receivers;  for this purpose, thoughts are considered to be symbolic, not dependent on language. The  detail level of the thoughts is insufficient for others to learn specific skills from the  subject. Thus, if the subject casts a spell, everyone within range knows what spell is  being cast before it takes effect, but no one learns any knowledge about how the spell is  cast.    If the broadcaster is invisible or hiding in shadows, the broadcast functions normally,  and all receivers are aware that someone is in the vicinity whom they cannot see. While  receivers cannot pinpoint the broadcaster's location, the broadcaster's thoughts will  inevitably reveal his general position (\"Oh no, he's looking right at me,\" etc.). A character  hiding in shadows will be automatically detected, while attacks against an invisible  broadcaster suffer a -2 penalty, rather than the normal -4. This spell totally negates the  chance of surprise by the broadcaster.    The subject must have an Intelligence score of 1 or more to become a broadcaster,  and must have a \"normal\" mind as understood by PCs. Thoughts that are broadcast can be  received only by individuals with Intelligence scores of 3 or better. An unwilling subject  receives a normal saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effects.

This cooperative spell  requires two priests who must spend the day casting this spell. During the casting, the  priests must decide which additional spells (of all levels) are desired. Upon completion of  the casting, the priests touch palms, and the priest of higher level receives a charge of  magical energy. This charge temporarily boosts the level of the priest for spellcasting  purposes. The amount of increase is one level per five levels of the lower level caster  (fractions rounded up). If both priests are of equal level, the casters must decide who  benefits from the spell.    The spell grants the priest the spellcasting ability of the new level. It does not  improve hit points, attack rolls, or other abilities. If the increase allows more spells per level, the additional spells are instantly placed in the character's memory. A priest is also  enabled to cast spells normally beyond his level. Range, duration, area of effect, and  other variables are all based on the character's temporary level.    The increased effect lasts only 1 turn. At the end of the turn, all additional spells are  lost and the character reverts to his normal level.    As an example, consider a party with a fallen comrade. The two priests in the party  are 7th and 8th level, both unable to cast raise dead. After a night's rest, each priest adds  uplift to his memorized spells. After casting the spell, the 8th-level priest suddenly gains  the casting abilities of a 10th-level priest, including the ability to cast raise dead. At the  end of one turn, the priest's abilities revert to 8th-level.    Casting this spell is an arduous task, causing a severe drain on the priests. When the  spell expires, the uplifted character suffers 2d6 points of damage from mental exhaustion.  This damage cannot be healed by any means until the character has had at least eight  hours of rest.

A death priest, for instance, might inflict a victim with an exaggerated fear of dying (requiring the character to make a saving throw vs. paralyzation to avoid the effects of a fear spell whenever he or she encounters a cadaver, human bones, a graveyard, or even an open coffin). Alternatively, the victim might become convinced that all corpses were undead, waiting to rip him or her to shreds. In a combat situation, a death priest will probably choose to quickly neutralize an opponent with an incapacitating form of insanity, such as confusion or feeblemindedness. The insanity is permanent and cannot be dispelled except by casting cure insanity (the reverse), heal, restoration, or wish. The reverse of this spell immediately cures insanity due to most causes (no saving throw). The spell must be administered while the patient is exhibiting insane symptoms. Cure insanity can heal a conscious victim of the effects of hallucinatory spores and repair psychic trauma (resulting from a mindwipe or other psionic assault). The spell also diminishes psychic exhaustion (restoring 5-40 PSPs). It cures madness resulting from spells (such as confusion, chaos, contact other plane, feeblemind, symbol of insanity, and prismatic spray, wall, or sphere) and also heals the insanity caused by certain magical items (such as an elixir of madness or a scarab of insanity). However, the spell will not control aberrant behaviors caused by lycanthropy, undeath, or powerful curses (such as a geas or quest). Finally, at the DM's discretion, cure insanity may temporarily calm the demented behavior of certain extraplanar creatures (such as slaad)."

    "description": "With this spell, an evil necromancer priest may exert his or her dark will on the still-beating heart of any living victim, provided the target remains in clear view (line of sight) and within the spell's range. After casting the spell, the priest must focus his or her entire concentration on the victim's heart for three rounds, during which time the caster may not cast other spells or engage in melee. The priest may, however, walk, talk, and take ordinary defensive precautions while the spell runs its course through the victim. During the first round of the spell, the victim must make a saving throw vs. death magic with a -2 penalty. This saving throw is modified according to the victim's hit point adjustment due to Constitution (+1 bonus for 15 Con, +2 for 16 Con, and so on; sec page 15 in the PHB for more on this). If the victim makes this first saving throw, the spell fails to take hold of his or her heart and has no further effect. If the victim foils the save, however, then he or she suffers a massive spasm of pain in the chest (similar to that felt in a heart attack), inflicting 1-8 points of damage on the victim and completely incapacitating the individual for one excruciating round. During the second round, the victim is entitled to another saving throw, this time with a -1 penalty (plusany bonuses for Con). As before, if the victim makes the save, the spell ends with no further effect. If failed, however, the victim's chest pain intensifies, as if a searing band of iron were being slowly tightened around the heart. The character experiences severe dizziness, disorientation, and terrible shooting pains in the arms, jaw, and left shoulder. Meanwhile, the victim loses 25% of any remaining hit points, is paralyzed with pain for 2-5 rounds, and immediately loses 2-5 points of Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity. Providing the victim survives the final stage of the spell (see below), these lost points are regained at a rate of 1 point in each these three ability scores per day. On the third round of the spell, the target must make a (third, unmodified) saving throw vs. death magic or suffer a massive heart attack, resulting in immediate death (onset time is 1 round, during which time, the victim is completely incapacitated). Alternatively, a kind DM might decide that the final phase of the spell merely plunges the victim into a deep, death-like coma, lasting 1-4 days and resulting in the permanent loss of 1 point of Constitution. This deadly spell may be thwarted in a number of ways. Successfully casting dispel magic on either the victim or the priest will disrupt the heart blight, as will casting a simple protection from evil spell on the victim or wearing a scarab of protection (this drains a charge, however). Furthermore, the victim may be entitled to repeat a saving throw with a +2 bonus if treated by another character with the healing nonweapon proficiency. Finally, the spell is immediately broken if the victim is transported out of range or removed from the priest's line of sight. Because of its murderous effect, this spell is only granted to wicked priests by the gods of Death, Disease, and Evil."

An air-walking creature is in control of its movement, except when a strong wind is blowing.

The creature can, at the DM's option, be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control of movement or suffering physical damage. The spell can be placed upon a trained mount, so it can be ridden through the air. Of course, a mount not accustomed to such movement would certainly need careful and lengthy training, the details for which are up to the DM.

Entities communed with structure their answers to further their own purposes. It is probable that the DM will limit the use of commune spells to one per adventure, one per week, or even one per month, for the greater powers dislike frequent interruptions. Likewise, if the caster lags, discusses the answers, or goes off to do anything else, the spell immediately ends. The material components necessary for a commune spell are the priest's religious symbol, holy (unholy) water, and incense. If a particularly potent commune is needed, a sacrifice proportionate with the difficulty of obtaining the information is required.

For every three levels of experience, the caster can increase or decrease wind force by one level of strength. Wind strengths are as follows: Wind Force Miles Per Hour Light Breeze    2-7 Moderate Breeze   8-18 Strong Breeze  19-31 Gale  32-54 Storm  55-72 Hurricane 73-176 Winds in excess of 19 miles per hour drive small flying creatures--those eagle-sized and under--from the skies, severely affect missile accuracy, and make sailing difficult. Winds in excess of 32 miles per hour drive even man-sized flying creatures from the skies and cause minor ship damage. Winds in excess of 55 miles per hour drive all flying creatures from the skies, uproot small trees, knock down wooden structures, tear off roofs, and endanger ships. Winds in excess of 73 miles per hour are of hurricane force. An \"eye\" of 40-foot radius, in which the wind is calm, exists around the caster. Note that while the spell can be used underground, if the spell is  cast in an area smaller than the area of effect, the eye shrinks 1 foot for every foot of confinement. For example, if the area of effect is a 360-foot area, the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a 30-foot radius; a space under 320 feet in a radius would eliminate the eye and subject the spellcaster to the effects of the wind. Once the spell is cast, the wind force increases or decreases by 3 miles per hour per round until the maximum or minimum speed is attained. The caster, with one round of complete concentration, can stabilize the wind at its current strength, or set it to increase or decrease. However, the rate of the change cannot be altered. The spell remains in force for one turn for each level of experience of the caster. When the spell is exhausted, the force of the wind wanes or waxes at the same rate, until it reaches the level it was at before the spell took effect. Another caster can use a control winds spell to counter the effects of a like spell up to the limits of his own ability."

In an environment free of normal insects, the spell fails. The insects obscure vision, limiting it to 10 feet. Spellcasting within the cloud is impossible. Creatures in the insect plague, regardless of Armor Class, sustain 1 point of damage for each round they remain within, due to the bites and stings of the insects. Invisibility is no protection. All creatures with 2 or fewer Hit Dice will automatically move at their fastest possible speed in a random direction until they are more than 240 yards away from the insects. Creatures with fewer than 5 Hit Dice must check morale; failure means they run as described above. Heavy smoke drives off insects within its bounds. Fire also drives insects away. For example, a wall of fire in a ring shape keeps a subsequently cast insect plague outside its confines, but a fireball spell simply clears insects from its blast area for one round. A single torch is ineffective against this vast horde of insects. Lightning, cold, or ice are likewise ineffective, while a strong wind that covers the entire plague area disperses the insects and ends the spell. The plague lasts two rounds for each level of the caster, and thereafter the insects disperse. The insects swarm in an area that centers around a summoning point determined by the spellcaster.

It is light and easy to pull, so that any character can use it without penalty for non- proficiency. It is magical: Each of its shimmering missiles is the equivalent of a +2 weapon, including attack and damage bonuses. Magic resistance can negate the effect of any missile fired from the bow. The bow fires seven missiles before disappearing. It can be fired up to four times per round. Each time a missile is fired, one hue leaves the bow, corresponding to the color of arrow that is released. Each color of arrow has the ability to cause double damage to certain creatures, as follows: Red --fire dwellers/users and fire elementals Orange --creatures or constructs of clay, sand, earth, stone or similar materials, and    earth elementals Yellow --vegetable opponents (including fungus creatures, shambling mounds, treants,    etc.) Green --aquatic creatures, electricity-using creatures, and air elementals Indigo --acid-using or poison-using creatures Violet --metallic or regenerating creaturesWhen the bow is drawn, an arrow of the appropriate color magically appears, nocked and ready. If no color is requested, or a color that has already been used is asked for, then the next arrow (in the order of the spectrum) appears. Bridge: The caster causes the rainbow to form a seven-hued bridge up to 3 feet wide per level of the caster. It must be at least 20 feet long and can be as long as 120 yards, according to the caster's desire. It lasts as long as the spell's duration or until ordered out of existence by the caster.

Likewise, other ills, such as poison and disease, are not negated. The raised person must roll a successful resurrection survival check to survive the ordeal (see Table 3: Constitution) and loses 1 point of Constitution. Further, the raised person is weak and helpless, needing a minimum of one full day of rest in bed for each day or fraction he was dead. The person has 1 hit point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic. A character's starting Constitution is an absolute limit to the number of times he can be revived by this means. The somatic component of the spell is a pointed finger. The reverse of the spell, slay living, grants the victim a saving throw vs. death magic. If the saving throw is successful, the victim sustains damage equal to that of a cause serious wounds spell--i.e., 2d8+1 points. Failure means the victim dies instantly."

The spike stones serve to impede progress through an area and to inflict damage. If an area is carefully observed, each observer is 25% likely to notice the sharp points of rock. Otherwise, those entering the spell's area of effect suffer 1d4 points of damage per round. The success of each attack is determined as if the caster of the spell were actually engaging in combat. Those entering the area are subject to attack immediately upon setting foot in the area and for each round spent in the area thereafter. The initial step enables the individual to become aware of some problem only if the initial attack succeeds; otherwise movement continues and the spike stones remain unnoticed until damage occurs. Charging or running victims suffer two attacks per round. Those falling into pits affected by spike stones suffer six such attacks for every 10 feet fallen, each attack having a +2 bonus to the attack roll. In addition, the damage inflicted by each attack increases by +2 for every 10 feet fallen. Finally, the creatures also suffer normal falling damage.

This creature, known as a spectator, appeared as a\nlarge orb dominated by an unblinking central eye with four stalks sprouting\nfrom the top of the orb to watch in each of the cardinal directions. In a dark\ntune in the church’s distant history, the forces of evil gained the upper hand\nfor a while. During this bleak period, various gods of evil corrupted Helm’s\ncreations into the horrors known as beholders and their kin. Priests of Bane\nclaim this is so much hogwash; they believe that the Black Lord created the\neye tyrants as the ultimate rulers, and spectators are Helm’s poor attempt at\ncopying Bane’s magnificent creation. The truth is unknown, although\npriests of Helm are known to destroy beholders and their kin wherever possible,\nand the remaining priests of Bane (and Xvim) return the favor to\nspectators whenever possible.\nThis spell enables priests of Helm to summon nearly infallible guardians\nto assist in their ordained tasks. Summon spectator summons one of Helm’s\nspectator servitors from Mechanus to the Prime Material Plane to serve for\nup to 101 years in a specified task. (Spectators are detailed under the Beholder\nand Beholder-kin entry in the MONSTROUS MANUAL™ tome.) The\ntask must involve the guarding of some location or inanimate physical object,\nsuch as a portal, shrine, or a holy relic. (The scope of things a spectator\nsummoned by summon spectator will guard is broader than what one\nsummoned by the particular variant of the 7th-level wizard spell monster\nsummoning V that normally summons spectators will guard.) It allows no\none except the one who summoned it or another priest of Helm to enter\nthe location it is guarding or to use, borrow, or examine an item or treasure\nit watches over. It is not gullible and can fairly easily detect false claims to\nmembership in Helm’s priesthood by questioning such claimants telepathically\nabout details of the church’s rituals and beliefs.\nA summoned spectator does not abandon its post unless slain or blinded\nin all five eyes, in which case it automatically returns to Helm’s tower in\nMechanus. Its eyes regenerate in 24 hours, after which time it returns to its\npost. If the object is gone or the location breached when it returns (it can\nautomatically tell), it again leaves for Mechanus, never to return.\nThe material components for this spell are the priests holy symbol and a\nsteel gauntlet blessed in the name of Helm; the latter is consumed in the\ncasting."

Creatures unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free themselves from the mud sink at the rate of 1/3 of their height per round and eventually suffocate, save for lightweight creatures that could normally pass across such ground. Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it, with the amount required decided by the DM. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can move through the area at a rate of 10 feet per round. The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance--but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt at a rate of 1d6 days per 10 cubic feet. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage. The reverse, transmute mud to rock, hardens normal mud or quicksand into soft stone (sandstone or similar mineral) permanently unless magically changed. Creatures in the mud are allowed a saving throw to escape before the area is hardened to stone. Dry sand is unaffected.

The wall of fire must be cast so that it is vertical with respect to the caster. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat, inflicting 2d4 points of damage upon creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of damage upon those within 20 feet. In addition, the wall inflicts 4d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level of the spellcaster, to any creature passing through it. Creatures especially subject to fire maytake additional damage, and undead always take twice normal damage. Note that attempting to directly catch moving creatures with a newly created wall of fire is difficult. A successful saving throw enables the creature to avoid the wall, while its rate and direction of movement determine which side of the created wall it is on. The wall of fire lasts as long as the priest concentrates on maintaining it, or one round per level of experience of the priest in the event he does not wish to concentrate upon it.

    "description": "While using this spell, the priest can command a flame to leave its source of fuel  and move at his direction. The flame is magically preserved at the intensity it possessed  when animated and does not weaken or fail even if it has nothing to burn. The priest can  affect any natural fire within range, but magical fires (including breath weapons) can only  be animated and controlled on a roll of 11 or higher on a d20, –1 per level or Hit Dice  difference between the caster and the creature or spellcaster who created the flame in  question. For example, a 9th-level priest can animate a flaming sphere cast by a 4th level  wizard on a roll of 6 or better on 1d20. In order to animate instantaneous effects such as a  red dragon’s breath or a fireball, the priest must beat his opponent’s initiative in the  round he casts this spell and succeed in his attempt to take control of the flame.    Under the priest’s direction, an animated flame can move at a rate of 12, although  it cannot cross water or wet or muddy ground. If the priest directs the flame to leave the     spell’s range, the spell ends and the flame stops and burns whatever it may be resting on.  Animate flame can be a very effective weapon; the fire attacks with a THAC0 of 10 and  may be able to strike several creatures in the same round, depending on its size. It inflicts  damage as shown below:        Number of  Size  Diameter    Targets  Damage  Torch or lantern  less than 1 ft.        1  1d3  Small campfire   1–2 ft.        1  1d4  Large campfire   3–5 ft.        2  1d6  Bonfire  6–10 ft.        4  2d6  Conflagration  11–20 ft.        8  3d6  Inferno   21 ft. or more       20  5d6      Creatures actually caught within the fire’s diameter are automatically hit (without  an attack roll) for the listed damage. Very hot or unusually cold fires may inflict damage  (at the DM’s discretion) as if they were one category larger or smaller. In addition to  attacking the caster’s enemies, the fire will naturally cause any combustibles it comes  into contact with to burn, as well; an animated fire can easily torch a small town, given a  few rounds to move from building to building.    The animated flame can be dispelled normally. It can also be defeated by contact  with a significant volume of water, ice, cold, or earth or dirt, just as a normal fire can be  drowned or smothered.    The priest can affect a single fire of up to 1 foot in diameter per level of  experience; if a natural fire is too large for him to animate, he can animate a smaller  portion of it and command the portion he controls. Magical fires cannot be divided in this  way, so it requires a very high-level priest to deflect the breath weapon of a red dragon! "

If used to banish an extraplanar or multidimensional creature, dimensional     translocation prevents the creature from returning to the Prime Material Plane for the  duration of the spell. The creature may be able to take other actions, such as using  magical items or spell-like abilities on itself while it waits to return. If the caster instead  forces an extradimensional creature into the Prime Material Plane, one or more of the  following effects may apply, at the DM’s option:       The creature’s Armor Class may be reduced by 1d6 points for the duration of the     spell.     The quality of a magical weapon needed to strike the creature may be reduced by     one “plus”; for example, a monster normally hit by +2 or better weapons may     become vulnerable to +1 weapons for the spell’s duration.

Until time catches up to him, he may  move about unhindered and observe his surroundings; no force known can detect his  presence or harm him in the alternate reality, although he in turn cannot affect any  creature or object in the physical world. For instance, he could read a book at the page it  was opened to, but he could not turn the page since that would require him to move an  object that is temporarily immovable for him. To his companions or enemy in real time,  the priest appears to simply vanish altogether, only to reappear at some later point.    The duration of this spell is a little odd, to say the least. The priest may choose a  duration of up to 1 round at 7th to 9th level, 2 rounds at 10th to 12th level, 3 rounds at  13th to 16th, 4 rounds at 17th to 19th, up to a maximum of 5 rounds at 20th level or  higher. The duration chosen by the priest governs the length of the othertime; if the priest  decides that the spell will last 2 rounds, then he is instantly transported to that point in  time, surrounded by the frozen still-life of the world as it will appear 2 rounds after the  priest cast othertime. The caster then has 2 rounds to himself to take any actions he cares  to, although he cannot affect the real world by any physical, magical, or mental means.    While the caster is in the othertime, he is completely unaware of the intervening  events. In the example above, if the caster’s friends were teleported away 1 round after  the caster left and replaced by an identical group of dopplegangers, the caster would have  no chance to detect the switch; all he sees are the bodies of his “friends,” frozen in the  positions they will occupy when he emerges from the othertime. This also means that  nasty things like dragon breath, cloudkills, or mind blasts that pass through the spot  where the caster happens to be have no effect on him—he simply does not exist in the  real world while he waits for everyone else to catch up to him.    As noted above, the caster gains an amount of subjective time equal to the  duration of the spell. By leaping 3 rounds into the future, the caster gains 3 rounds of  actions in the othertime. He could drink a potion, cast a spell, and then maneuver for an  attack, for example, or he could gain a 3-round head start by running for his life while no  one else can pursue him. If the priest uses this time to study a battle and position himself  for an attack, he gains a –4 bonus to his initiative roll on the round he emerges from  othertime, and a +4 attack bonus with his first strike.    Leaping in and out of the time stream is a dangerous activity; every time the priest  employs this spell, there is a 1% noncumulative chance that he becomes stuck in  othertime, doomed to death by thirst or starvation when his own rations run out. Only the  most extraordinary measures (a wish spell, divine intervention, etc.) can save a character  in this predicament. Once a priest is in othertime, he cannot pray for further spells. After  all, if the priest is going to attract his deity’s attention by praying for spells, the deity will  most likely allow him out! The material component for this spell is an hourglass filled  with rare salts, worth at least 100 gold pieces.    "

Creatures entering the area of effect after the initial creation of ice suffer no additional damage,  although the air will be noticeably dry and cold. However, the ice formed by the spell coats all surfaces and  may cause creatures to slip and fall. Any creature moving into or out of the affected area must make a  saving throw vs. spell or fall, losing their action for the round. The ice lasts at least 2 rounds per caster  level, and then begins to melt at whatever rate nature decrees.    If cast on a body of water, this spell creates an iceberg of the stated dimensions. A  swimmer or aquatic creature could be caught in the ice and trapped until the ice melts;  most air-breathers will suffocate from this treatment, but a few aquatic creatures (fish,  amphibians, etc.) may survive being frozen, at the DM’s discretion.

The spell draws bonuses from one person for every two levels of the priest. All characters involved must be within a 30'-radius of the priest. At the time of casting, the priest designates the recipient of the spell and the contributors. All characters who contribute to the spell must do so willingly.   When the spell is completed, the designated character (the group's champion) gains any non-magical bonuses to THAC0 and damage possessed by the characters who contributed to the spell. Characters without bonuses or with combat penalties could conceivably be included in the spell; such characters count against the maximum number of creatures that can be affected. Penalties are likewise applied to the champion; contributors to this spell must be chosen carefully.   The bonuses gained through this spell are added to the character's own bonuses (if any). The champion channels the energy of others through himself, improving his fighting ability.   The champion must be in the line of sight and within 30 feet of the characters aiding him. Characters who contribute their bonuses must concentrate on the champion for the duration of the spell. If this concentration is broken (by moving more than 10 feet per round, fighting, being struck, or losing sight of the champion), that character's contribution is immediately lost.   The spell expires when the last character contributing power to the champion ceases concentration.   A champion may benefit from only one champion's strength spell at one time. Contributors can aid only one champion at one time.   The material component is a chain of five gold links worth at least 1,000 gp. "

The caster can create a continuous path for the duration of the spell, clearing a 10-foot-square ahead of him as long as he continues to move forward. The spell affects jungles, forests, rocky ground, and snow.   The result of the cleared path is that movement costs are reduced by half. This is reflected in a reduction of the penalty against movement in rough terrain. (See Table 74 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for terrain costs for movement.) For example, if clear path is used in heavy jungle, the movement cost is reduced from 8 to 4. In no case can clear path reduce movement cost below 1.   Clear path has no effect on rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water, nor does it affect quicksand, lava, or similar natural obstacles. It also has no effect on magically-created terrain or manmade barricades.   A priest using the clear path spell can be tracked easily. Tracking proficiency is not required.   The material components are a knife blade and a straw from a broom.   The reverse, clutter path, causes weeds, small stones, and similar debris to litter a 10 foot path extending 10 feet behind the caster. This hides a trail, making tracking more difficult. The caster can create a continuous path for the duration of the spell. The chance to successfully track on a cluttered path is reduced by 50%.

For example, a nest of rot grubs caught in the cloud would \"melt,\" becoming small puddles of clean water. If the spell is cast over a body of water, the cloud merges with a portion of the water equal to its own size, transmuting any filth, microbes, small fish, or other \"impurities\" into clean water.   The cloud's vapors are heavier than air, so they sink to the lowest level of the land (even down holes in the ground). Thus, this spell is perfect for cleansing a sewer or well.

Using his knowledge of circumstances, the DM communicates these facts to the caster's player. This \"arcane message\" is normally straightforward and easy to understand, but in the case of highly complex circumstances, the message might be cryptic. In any case, the message will always be truthful.   As an example, consider a priest and his party who are on a holy quest to retrieve an item of power. On the way to the location of this item, the party is ambushed by evil creatures from the Inner Planes but manages to defeat them. Concerned that these creatures might be outlying guards protecting the item of interest, the priest casts consequence, hoping for guidance. The DM knows that these creatures have nothing to do with the quest; the encounter was coincidental. However, the surviving monsters will soon be returning with reinforcements to avenge their dead. Therefore, the DM tells the priest's player, \"To your goals these have no place, but still they can cause more woe.\"   Casting this spell \"taints\" subsequent castings of the same spell within a 24-hour span. A second attempt within this period always results in the same message as the first, regardless of the true situation. If a second priest casts the spell within 24 hours of another casting, he receives an accurate reading.

Disguise cannot change the size category of the unit's members. Thus, a unit of humans may appear to be a unit of elves, but may not appear as a unit of giants or halflings.

A 15th-level priest can triple the capacity or reduce it to one-third capacity.   If the size and capacity of an extradimensional space is decreased, any contents of the space that exceed the current capacity are expelled (determined randomly). These contents are expelled from the space in the same way they originally entered it, if that path is still open. If the path is closed, as it would be if a bag of holding were tied shut or a portable hole were folded up, the \"extra\" contents are expelled into the Astral plane. Any items in an enlarged space when the spell duration expires suffer the same fate.   Placing an extradimensional space inside another such space, such as placing a bag of holding inside a portable hole (see the Dungeon Master's Guide), is a dangerous undertaking. Extradimensional manipulation may be cast for the purpose of removing this danger. When used in this manner, the size of the space cannot be affected. However, while this version is in effect, the affected extradimensional space can be placed within another such space (or another extradimensional space may be placed within the affected space) with no adverse consequences. If one space is within the other when the spell expires, the usual consequences ensue immediately.   If the space to be affected is being maintained by a spellcaster, as in the case of a rope trick, that spellcaster receives a saving throw to resist the manipulation. If the space is created by a magical item, however, no saving throw is allowed.   The material component is a strip of gold tissue worth at least 5 gp that is twisted into a Moebius strip.

Once the spell is completed, there is no limit to the range over which it can function. However, both the caster and host must remain on the same plane. Since the spell relies on telepathic communication, thin lead sheeting will effectively block the connection.   When desired, the caster can dominate the host. When this happens, the host's own mind is pushed to the background and the caster's personality dominates. The host's personality, memories, proficiencies, and spells are temporarily replaced by those of the caster. While occupying the host, the caster can cast any spell he himself has memorized, provided that the necessary components are on hand. These spells function exactly as if the priest had cast them from his own body.   The caster can return control to the host at any time, restoring the character's abilities and personality without harm.   The spell is not without limitations and risks.

Every moment is virtually an independent event for the subject; he or she can remember recent events, thoughts, and sensations for no more than a few seconds (the amount of time they remain in short-term memory).   Memories of events that happened before the onset of the spell are not affected at all; these are safely stored in long-term memory. This means that the subject can cast any spells memorized before the memory wrack took effect, but he is likely to have difficulty casting the spell as described below.   The subject of this spell has a limited ability to act. He is restricted to one action at a time and must concentrate mightily to keep the situation and any planned actions in short term memory. As long as the subject is able to maintain concentration, he may act normally within these limits.   If the subject is distracted (he is struck in combat, affected by a spell, startled, surprised, or a similar event occurs), he forgets everything that occurred from the onset of the spell to the moment of distraction. The subject must re-evaluate the situation as if it had just come to pass.   Consider the following example. The subject of the spell is a soldier assigned to guard the entrance to a building. The priest arrives and casts memory wrack on the guard. The guard has no problem remembering his orders, since he received them before the onset of the spell. He also remembers the arrival of the priest. The priest now tries to convince the guard that he is authorized to enter the building. The guard refuses him entry. The priest now picks up a rock and throws it at the guard, striking him and distracting him. The guard forgets everything that happened between the onset of the spell and the moment the rock struck. He forgets that the priest has already tried to con him and that he threw a rock at him. He must reevaluate the situation as though the priest had just arrived. The priest is free to make another attempt at entering the building.

    "description": "This spell allows the priest to create one specific form of insanity in the subject. Five forms of insanity are possible through this spell.   Schizophrenia: This form of insanity is characterized by personality loss. The subject has no personality of his own, so he selects a role model and makes every possible attempt to behave like that character. The chosen role model will be as different from the subject as possible. (Thus, an insane wizard might begin to follow the habits of a warrior.) Obviously, a warrior who believes himself to be a wizard will be unable to cast spells (he might think that he's casting spells, or he might construct a sophisticated series of excuses explaining why he's \"not in the mood for magic\" at the moment). A character who emulates a member of another class does not gain any of the skills of that class and makes all attacks and saving throws as appropriate to his true class. Certain consequences might arise if the character's emulation causes him to break restrictions of his class. For example, a priest emulating a warrior might break his deity's prohibition against edged weapons, or a paladin might emulate a Neutral Evil thief. Both will suffer the appropriate consequences as if they had been compelled to violate their beliefs while charmed. Such characters will certainly have to atone for their actions once they return to normal.   Dementia praecox: The subject is totally uninterested in any undertaking. Nothing seems worthwhile, and the individual is lethargic and filled with tremendous feelings of boredom and dissatisfaction. No matter how important the situation, it is 50% likely that the subject will ignore it as meaningless.   Delusional insanity: The subject is convinced that he is a famous figure: a monarch, demi-god, or similar personage. Characters who fail to recognize the subject with the honor he deserves incur great hostility or disbelief. The subject acts appropriately to a station that he does not hold. He directs orders at real and imaginary creatures and draws upon resources that do not exist.   Paranoia: The subject is convinced that \"they\" (whoever they are) are spying on him and plotting against him. Everyone around the subject, even friends and allies, is part of the plot. If any other character acts in a way that the subject can interpret as reinforcing this delusion, the subject has a 20% chance of reacting with violence.   Hallucinatory insanity: The subject sees, hears, and otherwise senses things that do not exist. The more stressful the situation is to the subject, the more likely he will hallucinate. Although most hallucinations are external to the subject (that is, he perceives creatures, objects, and conditions that do not exist), there is a 10% chance that any hallucination will involve the subject's self-perception. For example, the subject might suddenly believe and act as if he had sprouted wings, grown to giant size, etc.   When this spell is cast by a priest of 13th level or lower, the DM chooses or randomly selects one of these forms of insanity (and should feel free to invent other interesting symptoms). If the priest is 14th level or higher, he can personally select the form of insanity to afflict the subject.   While under the effect of this spell, the subject can cast spells and use innate powers; the use of these abilities will be in accordance with the symptoms of the insanity, however. Player characters affected by this spell should be encouraged to role-play the appropriate effects to the limit.   The duration of this spell depends on the sum of the subject's Intelligence and Wisdom scores. A saving throw is allowed on a periodic basis depending on this total. The spell is broken if a successful saving throw is rolled. Refer to the table that follows.   Int+Wis   Time Between Checks  8 or less     1 month  9 to 18     3 weeks  19 to 24    2 weeks  25 to 30    1 week  31 to 35    3 days  36 or more    1 day     The effects of this spell can be removed by a limited wish, wish (or equally powerful magic), or by a heal spell cast for this specific purpose.   The material component is a small bust of a human head, about 3\" in height, made from fine, delicate china. The priest shatters this bust during the casting. "

    "description": "This spell compels its victim to repeat the action of the previous round. The result of the repetition is always identical to the original result.    For example, if a character fired an arrow and inflicted 4 points of damage, a repeat action spell will cause him to fire a second arrow that will also inflict 4 points of damage. As long as the victim of the first arrow is within range, the subject affected by repeat action will adjust his aim and fire the second arrow at him. If the victim of the arrow moves out of range, the subject will fire his second arrow in the direction of the recipient. If the recipient is out of sight, the subject will fire in the direction of the recipient's original location.   The subject of a repeat action spell must be capable of performing the indicated action a second time. If a character has no arrows in his quiver, he cannot fire an arrow. If a wizard were ordered to repeat a spell, he would attempt the spell only if he had the spell memorized and had sufficient material components. If a subject discovered a gem during a given round, repeat action will only compel him to hunt again; he will not recover another gem unless a second gem is actually present.    An unwilling subject is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to resist the effects of repeat action.   The material components are two identical glass spheres, each an inch or less in diameter. "

    "description": "This cooperative spell can be cast by either a single priest or a group of priests. Thoughtwave allows the priest to send a short but powerful message to one or more specific individuals, informing them of his situation and general location. The spell instantly generates a powerful mental impulse indicative of the caster's general mental state--anger, fear, pain, despair, etc.   The caster can designate as many as ten persons to receive this message, provided they can all be specifically named or grouped in a general category. Thus, the caster could designate a group of characters by name or could target \"fellow priests,\" \"superiors,\" \"adventuring companions,\" \"knights of Lord Harcourt,\" or \"villagers of Dopp.\" If more than ten individuals are in the group, those closest to the source will receive the impulse.   There is no range limitation to the spell, although it cannot be projected outside the plane occupied by the caster.   Creatures receiving the impulse automatically know who sent it (even if they have never met the priest before) and gain a clear indication of the mood and situation of the caster. Recipients also intuitively know the general source of the spell, although they are unable to pinpoint rooms, dungeon levels, or landmarks. For example, a fighter could suddenly be struck by an image of Father Rastibon, who is injured and in great pain somewhere along the forest road. A priest might suddenly sense that his patriarch is being tortured in the dungeons of Castle Varrack.   The spell can also be cast by more than one priest, allowing them to either contact greater numbers of individuals or increase the intensity of the message. If greater numbers are desired, ten characters are contacted per priest involved in the casting.   Increasing the intensity of the message makes it more compelling. Doubling the intensity (requiring at least three priests) causes the message to act as a suggestion. In this case, the effect is limited to a single target. Tripling the intensity (requiring at least five priests) gives the spell the force of a quest. This effect is also limited to a single target. In both cases, the target is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect of the suggestion or quest.  "

If the priest leaves the circle, the spell is broken. When the spell ends, the priest must rest for 1 turn per hour (or portion thereof) spent in the circle. If the priest is forced into action (by being attacked, for example), he can move at only half his normal movement rate, has an Armor Class penalty of -2, an attack penalty of -2, and loses all Dexterity combat bonuses.

The agonizing symptoms persist until a victim receives a cure disease, heal, or restoration spell bestowed by a more powerful priest than the original caster. Dispel magic and remove curse are powerless to mediate the symptoms of a scourge, but a wish will eradicate the infection immediately. A scourge may also lead to a long-term, debilitating illness. Those ignoring the malignant disease resulting from the spell's effects for more than a few days may be susceptible to much worse afflictions (such as gangrene, plague, or leprosy) that ultimately result in the victim's untimely death within 1-4 weeks. Furthermore, if a victim of the spell enters an area of dense population, there is always a chance that the disease may spread (1% per caster level) into an epidemic of massive proportions. These long-term effects of the scourge are left to the discretion of the DM. The material component is a specially prepared, black whip or riding crop, which is cracked in the direction of the intended victims during the casting of the spell.

If the creature to be fetched cannot detect invisible objects, the aerial servant attacks, automatically gaining surprise.

When a hit is scored, the aerial servant has grabbed the item or creature it was sent for.

If the creature in question does not have a Strength rating, roll 1d8 for each Hit Die the aerial servant and the creature grabbed have. The higher total is the stronger.

Thus a large stone pedestal would rock forward at 10 feet per round, a stone statue would move at 40 feet per round, a wooden statue 80 feet per round, an ivory stool of light weight would move at 120 feet per round. Slithering movement is about 10 feet to 20 feet per round; rolling is 30 feet to 60 feet per round. The damage caused by the attack of an animated object depends on its form and composition. Light, supple objects can only obscure vision, obstruct movement, bind, trip, smother, etc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or otherwise strike for 1d2 points of damage or possibly obstruct and trip, as do light, supple objects. Hard, medium-weight objects can crush or strike for 2d4 points of damage, while larger and heavier objects may inflict 3d4, 4d4, or even 5d4 points of damage. The frequency of attack of animated objects depends on their method of locomotion, appendages, and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every five melee rounds to as frequently as once per round. The Armor Class of the object per round. The Armor Class of the object animated is basically a function of material and movementability. Damage depends on the type of weapon is effective against fabric, leather, wood, and like substances. Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are useful against wood, stone, and metal objects. Your DM will determine all of these factors, as well as how much damage the animated object can sustain before being destroyed. The priest can animate one cubic foot of material for each experience level he has attained. Thus, a 14th-level priest could animate one or more objects whose solid volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet[md]a large statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen average crocks."

    "description": "The fire seeds spell creates special missiles or timed incendiaries that burn with great heat. The spell can be cast to create either fire seed missiles or fire seed incendiaries, as chosen when the spell is cast. Fire seed missiles: This casting turns up to four acorns into special grenadelike missiles that can be hurled up to 40 yards. An attack roll is required to strike the intended target, and proficiency penalties are considered. Each acorn bursts upon striking any hard surface, causing 2d8 points of damage and igniting any combustible materials within a 10-foot diameter of the point of impact. If a successful saving throw vs. spell is made, a creature within the burst area receives only one-half damage, but a creature struck directly suffers full damage (i.e., no saving throw). Fire seed incendiaries: This casting turns up to eight holly berries into specialincendiaries. The holly berries are most often placed, being too light to make effective missiles. They can be tossed only up to 6 feet away. They burst into flame if the caster is within 40 yards and speaks a word of command. The berries instantly ignite, causing 1d8 points of damage to any creature and igniting any combustible within a 5-foot-diameter burst area. Creatures within the area that successfully save vs. spell suffer half damage. All fire seeds lose their power after a duration equal to one turn per experience level of the caster--e.g., the seeds of a 13th-level caster remain potent for a maximum of 13 turns after their creation. No other material components beyond acorns or holly berries are needed for this spell."

Alignment different with respect to law and chaos: Save vs. spell to enter the area; if failed, suffer 2d6 points of damage. If password locked, cannot enter unless password is known.

In addition to the priest's holy symbol, components include holy water and rare incenses worth at least 1,000 gp per 60-foot cube.

The tree upon which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of the caster's dwellingplace, within a place sacred to the caster, or within 100 yards of something that the caster wishes to guard or protect. The liveoak spell can be cast upon a healthy tree of small, medium, or large size, according to desire and availability. A triggering phrase of up to maximum of one word per level of the spellcaster is then placed upon the targeted oak. For instance, \"Attack any persons who come near without first saying sacred mistletoe\" is an 11-word trigger phrase that could be used by a caster of 11th level or higher casting the spell.

Damage to the tree can be healed with a plant growth spell, which restores 3d4 points of damage. A plant growth spell used in this fashion does not increase the size or hit points of the liveoak beyond the original value. The caster needs his holy symbol to cast this spell."

Objects less than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed splinter andbreak, and the pieces move with the wave of force. Thus, objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those carrying them with them. If a spear is planted to prevent this forced movement, it splinters. Even magical items with wooden sections are turned, although an anti-magic shell blocks the effects. A successful dispel magic spell ends the effect. Otherwise, the turn wood spell lasts for one round for each experience level of the caster. The waves of force continue to sweep down the set path for the spell's duration, pushing back wooden objects in the area of effect at a rate of 40 feet per melee round.

Negative ACs subtract from the base 8 points of damage, but no adjustment is made for Dexterity. Any creature within the area of effect of the spell when it is cast, crashes into the wall of thorns and must break through to move. The damage is based on each 10-foot thickness of the barrier. If the wall of thorns is chopped at, it takes at least four turns to cut a path through a 10- foot thickness. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fires burn away the barrier in two turns, creating a wall of fire effect while doing so (see wall of fire spell). In this case, the cool side of the wall is that closest to the caster of the thorn wall. The nearest edge of the wall of thorns appears up to 80 yards distant from the caster, as he desires. The spell's duration is one turn for each level of experience of the caster, and it covers one 10-foot cube per level of the caster in whatever shape the caster desires. Thus a 14th-level caster could create a wall of thorns up to 70 feet long by 20 feet high (or deep) by 10 feet deep (or high), a 10-foot-high by 10-foot-wide by 140-foot-long wall to block a dungeon passage, or any other sort of shape that suited his needs.

The warping effect of the field causes any  melee or hand-to-hand attack to miss 50% of the time—even if the roll allows an attack  to continue, the priest still gains a –2 bonus to his Armor Class. Normal missiles or  hurled weapons miss automatically as the entropy shield deflects them from the caster.  Even magical missile attacks (produce flame, magic missile, or Melf’s acid arrow, for  example), siege engines, and giant-thrown boulders may be deflected as if they were  hand-to-hand attacks.    Against spells or effects that produce energy, gas, or other physical attack forms  (fireball, lightning bolt, cloudkill, and other such spells) the entropy shield provides a  50% chance that the attack simply does not affect the protected priest. Even if the  harmful energy or matter penetrates the shield, the caster gains a +2 bonus on his saving  throw. This does not cause a spell to fizzle or fail; a priest standing in the middle of a  fireball is simply not touched by the spell, which will inflict its normal damage on  anyone else in the area of effect. Any spell or effect that does not create matter or energy  to harm or hinder the victim can pass through the entropy shield normally, so mind-based  attacks and magical effects such as petrification, paralyzation, enfeeblement, or  polymorph (to name a few) can still affect the priest.    In addition to its defensive benefits, the entropy shield has the ability to repel  normal or giant-sized animals and creatures of lawful alignment, such as extraplanar  monsters from the lawful planes. Any such creature attempting to attack the shielded  priest in hand-to-hand combat must roll a saving throw vs. spell at the end of the round.

If the cyclone exceeds  the spell’s range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds—possibly  endangering the caster or his allies—and then dissipates.    Any creature of size L (large) or smaller that comes in contact with the whirlwind  must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon or suffer 2d8 damage.

The DM determines a monster's current age and natural life span based on its description in the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM or based on his own judgment. To determine the effects of aging on a monster, assume the following: a monster is middle-aged when it reaches half its natural life span; a monster reaches old age at two-thirds of its natural life span; a monster reaches venerable age in the last one-sixth of its years. A monster suffers the penalties which follow when it reaches these age levels. The penalties are cumulative and permanent (unless the affected monster becomes younger).  Age   Penalty  Middle Age  -1 to all saving throws  Old Age   -1 to all saving throws    -1 to all attack rolls  Venerable   -1 to all saving throws    -1 to all attack rolls     The material component is a pinch of powdered emerald.   The reverse of this spell, restore youth, permanently restores age that has been lost as a result of magic (such as an age creature spell). Restore youth reduces the age of the targeted creature by one year per level of the caster. The subject must make a successful system shock roll to survive the change. Subjects who become younger regain the lost ability scores described above. A subject cannot become younger than his actual age as a result of this spell.   The material component is a pinch of powdered ruby. "

The enchanted surface can be no larger than a square whose sides equal the caster's level times 2 feet (a 13th-level priest could affect a 26' x 26' surface).   The spell activates 1d4 rounds after any creature other than the caster enters the room. The intruder must be larger than a normal rat (larger than one-half cubic foot or weighing more than three pounds). When activated, the enchanted surface moves toward the opposite surface at a rate of 3 feet per round. Unless the spell is canceled by the caster, the enchanted surface continues to move until one of the following events occurs:   •A creature with sufficient Strength (minimum score of 19) stops the enchanted surface from moving by succeeding a Strength check. Such a creature suffers no damage from the enchanted surface. If the creature prevents the enchanted surface from moving for three consecutive rounds, the wall returns to its original position and the spell is negated. If multiple creatures attempt to stop the wall, the highest strength score is used as a base score; one point is added to that score for every creature assisting. Thus, a creature with 16 Strength assisted by three creatures could attempt to stop the wall.   •A strong or heavy object made of stone, wood, or metal is placed in the path of the wall. If the item survives a saving throw vs. crushing  blow, the object successfully braces the wall. If the object holds for three consecutive rounds, the surface returns to its original position and the spell is negated. The DM must use discretion in determining the types of objects that will brace the wall.   •Dispel magic or a similar spell or magical item is used to cancel the crushing wall.   Creatures can avoid being crushed by using a potion of diminution, potion of gaseous form, or other devices or spells that reduce size. The crushing wall almost never touches the opposite wall, usually being stopped by debris. A gap of two inches or more usually remains between the walls.   If the wall is not stopped, it causes crushing damage to everyone in the room. All creatures must make a saving throw vs. death. Those who fail are crushed to death. Those who save successfully suffer 5d10 points of damage. When the wall can move no farther, it returns to its original position and the spell is negated.   The material components are a 1-inch iron cube and a walnut shell. "

While disbelief remains in effect, these objects or creatures cannot harm or hinder the caster. He can pass through them as if they did not exist and takes no damage from their attacks or actions. However, since these objects or creatures temporarily do not exist for the priest, he can take no action against them. If the creatures attack, the caster receives no Dexterity bonus to armor class (since this bonus represents dodging, and the priest is unable to dodge a creature that does not exist for him).   The caster can attempt to disbelieve as many as four creatures within 60 feet of his position at the time of casting. He disbelieves the same four creatures for the duration of the spell. Alternatively, the priest can disbelieve any or all inanimate objects of up to 20 cubic-yard volume (thus, he may disbelieve a 12 foot by 15 foot area of 3-foot-thick wall). This volume must be centered on a point no more than 20 yards from the caster. These two options are mutually exclusive; the priest can disbelieve only creatures or objects, not a combination of both.   Disbelieving a creature includes all gear, equipment, or treasure carried or worn by that creature; it does not include other objects that come into contact with that creature, such as walls, doors, chairs, etc.  Disbelief is not automatic; it requires an extreme effort. To successfully disbelieve, the priest must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. A successful save means the priest has disbelieved; an unsuccessful check means that the spell has failed and the priest has not convinced himself of the creatures' or objects' non-existence.   While this spell is in effect, the DM must record any damage suffered by the priest from disbelieved creatures. When the spell ends, the caster makes a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, the priest suffers only one-eighth of any damage inflicted by the creatures (round all fractions down); if the priest fails the saving throw, he suffers one-half of any damage inflicted (round fractions down).

    "description": "This spell changes the characteristics of a square region of terrain. The area can be no more than 120 yards on a side. The priest can effectively turn a flat plain into a slope of any direction, or may flatten an existing slope. The spell does not allow the priest to alter the pull of gravity, however.   This spell lets the priest create or negate a height differential of as much as 20 feet (a 2\" slope in BATTLE SYSTEM™ rules measurements) within the area of effect. This can have various consequences; the best way to discuss the effects is by example.   Example 1: Two units face each other on a flat plain. The priest can alter the slope of the terrain so that one unit is 2\" of elevation higher than the other. The unit that is upslope gains the combat benefits for higher ground, and the unit that is downslope must pay the movement cost for moving uphill if it wishes to approach the other unit.   Example 2: One unit is on flat terrain; another unit, 6\" away, is on a hill of 2\" elevation. Using this spell, the priest can effectively eliminate this difference in elevation (raising the low ground or lowering the high ground). All combat and movement involving these two units is then conducted as if there were no elevation difference (i.e., no movement penalty, no combat benefit for higher ground, etc.). Alternatively, the priest could increase the height differential by 2\". Combat and movement would now be conducted as if the total difference in elevation were 4\".   Example 3: A unit faces a hill of 3\" elevation. The priest casts gravity variation, decreasing the effective elevation of the hill to 1\". The unit pays a lower movement point cost to climb the hill. Alternatively, if the unit facing the hill were an enemy unit, the priest could increase the effective elevation to 5\".   The priest must specify the degree and direction of change at the moment of casting. These parameters cannot be changed while the spell remains in effect.   Gravity variation can have dramatic effects on siege engines and towers. Most siege engines can be moved only on the most gentle of slopes. By raising or lowering the effective elevation of siege engines by 2\", the priest can totally immobilize them by positioning them on a slope too steep to negotiate. In the case of siege towers, there is a 50% chance that the structures will topple over (totally destroying them).   The material component is a tiny plumb bob; the plumb line must be made of platinum wire while the bob itself must be a gem of at least 1,000 gp value. The device is consumed in the casting."

    "description": "The great circle is a powerful cooperative spell that can be used only by four or more priests, each casting the spell simultaneously. Because of the nature of this spell and its casting time, it is often used to cleanse grounds in preparation for the construction of a temple or sanctuary.   When casting the great circle, the priests stand in a circle of no more than 20-foot diameter. Each faces inward; when the spell is completed, each priest faces outward, directing the energy of the spell.   When the casting is complete, the spell takes the form of a radiant halo of golden light 20 feet above the ground. This halo quickly expands in a shimmering wave. It can pass through objects, with small arcs of the halo disappearing momentarily and reappearing on the far side. As the halo moves, it generates a high-pitched hum that varies in pitch, almost like a chorus. The halo moves slowly at first, but builds speed, reaching its maximum range at the end of one round.   The radius of the golden halo is dependent on the number of priests casting the spell. Each priest adds 60 feet to the radius. Thus, four priests could generate a halo that extends 240 feet in all directions from the circle of priests. Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of priests who may contribute to this spell, but the need for the priests to be within a 20-foot diameter circle sets a practical limit of 20 casters.   The halo is pure energy tapped from the Positive Material plane. It causes harm to undead and  evil beings within the area of effect. Undead creatures of 8 or fewer hit dice are instantly destroyed and are not allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect. More powerful undead suffer 1d8 points of damage per caster. A successful saving throw vs. death magic reduces this damage to half. Creatures of evil alignment suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster (a saving throw is allowed for half-damage).   The reverse of this spell, the black circle, creates a ring of shimmering black energy. Paladins and priests of good alignment suffer 1d10 points of damage per priest in the circle. All other good creatures suffer 1d4 points of damage per caster. Affected creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. death magic to reduce the damage to one-half. "

Any missile weapon or spell that intersects this disk is instantaneously reversed in direction. Melee factors such as speed, range, and damage are unaffected; the direction of the object or force is simply rotated through a 180 degree arc. The sender of the spell or missile finds himself the target of his own attack.   The physical mirror operates from only one direction; that is, only one side of the mirror reflects attacks. The caster of the mirror may direct spells and missile attacks normally through the space occupied by the mirror.   In the case of physical attacks, the attacker must roll to hit himself (without the armor class benefits of Dexterity or shield). Spells turned back may require the caster to make a saving throw vs. his own spell. In both of these cases, range is important.  If the distance between the initiator of the attack and the physical mirror is more than twice the range of the attack, the attacker is safe; the attack has insufficient range to travel from the attacker to the mirror and back again.   When the priest casts the spell, he must specify the location and orientation of the physical mirror disk. Once it is created, the disk cannot be moved.   If two physical mirror disks touch or intersect, they destructively interact and both immediately vanish. The resulting \"ripples\" in the space-time continuum are exceedingly destructive and inflict 3d10 hit points of damage on any creature within 35 yards (a saving throw is allowed for half-damage).

All creatures and items in the area of effect stand motionless, rivers stop running, and arrows hang suspended in the air. Any creature, person, or object entering the area of effect is likewise frozen in time. The caster is affected if he is within the area of effect, unless he is the subject of the spell.   An unwilling subject is allowed a saving throw vs. spell; if successful, the spell is immediately negated. Otherwise, the victim is forced to relive all the actions taken in the previous 1-4 rounds in reverse. Beginning with the most recent round, the subject moves backward, arrows fired by the subject return to his bow, and so on. All effects of these actions are negated. At the end of the spell's duration, normal time resumes and all creatures immediately continue their activities, picking up right where they had stopped.   Consider the following example. A party is battling a spellcasting red dragon. In the first round, the dragon breathes fire, roasting the party's wizard. The rest of the group attacks and injures the dragon. On the second round, the dragon bites and kills the group's thief. More damage is caused to the beast, but it is still alive in the third round, when it uses magic missile to kill the ranger. At this point, the priest casts reverse time on the beast. Fortunately, it fails its saving throw and is forced to reverse the last four rounds. While everyone else freezes, the dragon goes into reverse. The magic missiles zoom back to the dragon (and it regains the ability to cast that spell), it \"unbites\" the thief (removing that damage from the character), and then inhales its fiery breath (leaving the roasted wizard alive and uncooked). The dragon is then reversed through one more round--the round before it encounterd the party. The spell then ends and actions resume.   The dragon must now roll for surprise since it is encountering the party for the first time. The party is immune to surprise, since it was fighting the beast previously. All damage suffered by the dragon remains, since these actions were caused by the group and not the beast.   The material component is an etched silver arrow bent into a circle.

The casting effort severely weakens the priests, discouraging casual use of this spell.   To cast the spell, six or more priests must be within a 15-foot radius. Each priest must cast spiritual wrath at the same time. Before beginning the spell, the priests must decide upon the area of effect. The spell causes 10d6+1d6 points of damage per priest casting the spell. (The minimum damage, therefore, is 16d6.) Creatures within the area of effect are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to reduce the damage to half.   The spell strikes as a great wave of force that descends from the sky. Small objects must save vs. crushing blow. Structures suffer damage as if hit by a heavy catapult (2d12). The force of this spell often raises a great cloud of dirt and dust, obscuring the area for 1d4+1 rounds.   The spell's area of effect is determined by the number of casters. Each priest contributes 10 feet to the radius of the spell. Six casters would create a spell with a radius of 60 feet. No more than twelve casters can cooperate to cast this spell (maximum of 22d6 damage and a 120-foot radius area of effect). This converts to an 8-inch circle in the BATTLESYSTEM™ rules ground scale.   The spell is difficult to cast, physically taxing the spellcasters so much that each caster suffers 3d10 points of damage from the effort. There is no saving throw allowed to avoid this damage.  "

    "description": "This spell asphyxiates individuals (chosen by the priest) who fail a saving throw vs. death magic. If fewer than six individuals are targeted with this spell, each receives a -1 penalty on their save (-2 for three creatures or less, -4 if the entire spell is focused on a single creature). This necromancy induces a victim's throat to constrict and his or her lungs to swell shut, similar to a severe allergic reaction, for so long as the subject remains within range of the spell. Each round, a victim must attempt a Constitution check. If failed, the victim suffers 1 - 6 points of damage. If successful, the subject manages to gasp in enough air to reduce the damage to 1-3 points. During its struggles against asphyxiation, the affected creature becomes effectively slowed (as per the 3rd- level wizard spell). A victim who fails three consecutive Constitution checks has been smothered and dies automatically on the following round. The effects of asphyxiate continue until either the spell expires, a victim withdraws beyond range of the spell, or a successful dispel magic is employed on a victim. Victims remain slowed for 1-3 rounds after the spell ends. This spell normally affects only humans or demihumans, though the DM may extend the dominion of the spell to include man-sized or smaller animals and monsters. Obviously, creatures (such as undead and plant creatures) that never breathe cannot be affected by this spell. The material component is an unholy symbol and a (symbolic) silken gag, which the priest loosely wraps around his or her own mouth after casting the spell. Because of its murderous effect, asphyxiate is typically granted only to priests serving evil deities."

More powerful, intelligent undead may attempt to parley with the priest, but they will invariably end the conversation and attack once their initial curiosity has been satisfied. A priest must be prepared to command, cajole, entice, or destroy whatever creature has been called into his service.

In truly rare circumstances (for instance, if the spell is cast near a creature's lair), this spell might attract the attention of a more powerful undead, such as a death knight, vampire, or even a lich. These beings will seldom arrive in a predictable fashion and are the most likely to demand some form of nasty retribution or lavish sacrifice to appease. The summoned undead remain in the vicinity of the priest for at least one turn per level and may be commanded to assist the priest in his or her endeavors (including, possibly, attacking the caster's opponents). Unless fortified with resist turning, the undead summoned by this spell can be turned (or commanded) by priests other than the caster. Because it enlists the service of powerful and malicious undead, summon undead is granted only to priests serving evi deities."

It has no intelligence or volition of its own, but it follows instructions exactly as spoken. Only one set of instructions for one single action can be given to the animated rock, and the directions must be brief, about a dozen words or so. The rock remains animated for one round per experience level of the caster. The volume of rock that can be animated is also based on the experience level of the caster--2 cubic feet of stone per level, such as 24 cubic feet, a mass of about man-sized, at 12th level. While the exact details of the animated rock are decided by the DM, its Armor Class is no worse than 5, and it has 1d3 hit points per cubic foot of volume. It uses the attack roll of the caster. The maximum damage it can inflict is 1d2 points per caster level. Thus, a 12th-level caster's rock might inflict 12 to 24 points of damage. Movement for a man- sized rock is 60 feet per round. A rock generally weighs from 100 to 300 pounds per cubic foot. The material components for the spell are a stone and drop of the caster's blood."

    "description": "By means of this spell, a priest is able to project his astral body into the Astral plane, leaving his physical body and material possessions behind on the Prime Material plane. As the Astral plane touches upon the first levels of all the outer planes, the priest can travel astrally to the first level of any of these outer planes as he wills. The priest then leaves the Astral plane, forming a body on the plane of existence he has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material plane by means of the astral spell. However, a second body cannot be formed on the Prime Material plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures on the Astral plane. The astral body is connected at all times to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially, but generally only the psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the caster's bodywhere the body rests on the Prime Material plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes. The spell lasts until the priest desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic spell or destruction of the priest's body on the Prime Material plane--which kills the priest. The priest can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with himself by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the priest. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the priest and can be stranded if something happens to the priest. Travel in the Astral plane can be slow or fast, according to the priest's desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the desire of the priest."

When the priest plants the end of the staff in the ground and speaks a special command and invocation, the staff turns into a treantlike creature with 12 Hit Dice, 40 hit points, and Armor Class 0. It attacks twice per round, inflicting 4d6 points of damage with every successful attack. The staff-treant defends the caster and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. The transformation lasts either for as many turns as the caster has experience levels, until the caster commands the staff to return to its true form, or until the staff is destroyed, whichever occurs first. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 hit points or less, it crumbles to a sawdustlike powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff can be used again after 24 hours and the staff- treant is at full strength. To cast a changestaff spell, the caster must have either his holy symbol or leaves (ash, oak, or yew) of the same sort as the staff. The staff for the changestaff spell must be specially prepared. The staff must be a sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew tree struck by lightning no more than 24 hours before the limb is cut. The limb must then be cured by sun drying and special smoke for 28 days. Then it must be shaped, carved, and polished for another 28 days. The caster cannot adventure or engage in other strenuous activity during either of these periods. The finished staff, engraved with woodland scenes, is then rubbed with the juice of holly berries, and the end of it is thrust into the earth of the caster's grove while he casts a speak with plant spell, calling upon the staff to assist in time of need. The item is then charged with a magic that will last for many changes from staff to treant and back again."

The passengers must be touched by the caster to protect them from the flames of the chariot. Creatures other than the caster and his designated passengers sustain 2d4 points of fire damage each round if they come within 5 feet of the horses or chariot. Such creatures suffer no damage if they evade the area by rolling successful saving throws vs. petrification, with Dexterity adjustments. The caster controls the chariot by verbal command, causing the flaming steeds to stop or go, walk, trot, run or fly, and turn left or right as he desires. Note that the chariot of Sustarre is a physical manifestation and can sustain damage. The vehicle and steeds are struck only by magical weapons or by water (one quart of which inflicts 1 point of damage). They are Armor Class 2, and each requires 30 points of damage to dispel. Naturally, fire has no effect upon either the vehicle or its steeds, but magical fires other than those of the chariot can affect the riders. Other spells, such as a successful dispel magic or holy word, will force the chariot back to its home plane, without its passengers. The chariot can be summoned only once per week. The material components are a small piece of wood, two holly berries, and a fire source at least equal to a torch."

Those who fail their saving throws are checked by the DM for actions each round, for the duration of the spell, or until the \"wander away for the duration of the spell\" result occurs. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible in their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). This is not panicked flight. Wandering creatures also have a 50% chance of using any special innate movement abilities (plane shift, burrowing, flight, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature. The material component of this spell is a set of three nut shells. Note: If there are many creatures involved, the DM may decide to assume average results. For example, if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected to successfully roll the saving throw, then four are assumed to have succeeded, one wanders away, four attack the nearest creature, six stand confused and the last acts normally but must check next round. Since the orcs are not near the party, the DM decides that two who are supposed to attack the nearest creature attack each other, one attacks an orc that saved, and one attacks a confused orc, which strikes back. The next round, the base is 11 orcs, since four originally saved and one wandered off. Another one wanders off, five stands confused, four attack, and one acts normally."

For example, a day that is clear, warm, and with moderate wind can be controlled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Contradictions are not possible--fog and strong wind, for example. Multiple control weather spells can be used only in succession. The material components for this spell are the priest's religious symbol, incense, and prayer beads or similar prayer object. Obviously, the spell functions only in areas where there are appropriate climatic conditions. If Weather is a major sphere for the priest (as it is for druids), duration and area are doubled, and the caster can change the prevailing weather by two places.

A creature of an alignment opposed to the priest (e.g., evil if the priest is good, chaotic if the priest is lawful) cannot be ordered around unless it is willing. Note that an absolute (true) neutral creature is effectively opposed to both good and evil, and both law and chaos. The spellcaster must know something about the creature to exact service from it, or else he must offer some fair trade in return for the service. That is, if the priest is aware that the creature has received some favor from someone of the priest's alignment, then the exaction spell can name this as cause. If no balancing reason for service is known, then some valuable gift or service must be pledged in return for the exaction. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the past or promised favor or reward, and with the being's effort and risk. The spell then acts, subject to a magic resistance roll, as a quest upon the being that is to perform the required service. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to the vicinity of the priest, and the priest must then and there return the promised reward, whether it is irrevocable cancellation of a past debt or the giving of some service or other material reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane. The DM adjudicates when an equitable arrangement has been reached. If the caster requests too much, the creature is free to depart or to attack the priest (as if the agreement were breached) according to its nature. If circumstances leave the situation unbalanced (for example, the creature dies while achieving a result that was not worth dying for), then this might create a debt owed by the caster to the creature's surviving kith and kin, making the caster vulnerable to a future exaction spell from that quarter. Agreeing to a future exaction or release in the event of catastrophic failure or death are common casterpledges in securing an exaction. Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in the priest being subject to exaction by the subject creature or by its master, liege, etc., at the very least. At worst, the creature can attack the reneging priest without fear of any of his spells affecting it, for the priest's failure to live up to the bargain gives the creature immunity from the priest's spell powers. The material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol, some matter or substance from the plane of the creature from whom an exaction is expected, and knowledge of the creature's nature or actions that is written out on a parchment that is burned to seal the pledge."

Once the item is enchanted, the priest must give it willingly to an individual, at the same time informing him of a command word to be spoken when the item is to be used. To make use of the item, the recipient must speak the command word at the same time that he rends or breaks the item. When this is done, the individual and all that he is wearing and carrying (up to the maximum encumbrance limit for the character) are instantly transported to the sanctuary of the priest, just as if the individual were capable of speaking a word of recall spell. No other creatures can be affected. The reversed application of the spell causes the priest to be transported to the immediate vicinity of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word said. The priest has a general idea of the location and situation of the item's possessor, and can choose not to be affected by this summons. This decision is made at the instant when the transportation is to take place. However, if he chooses not to go, the opportunity is gone forever and the spell is wasted. The cost of preparing the special item (for either version of the spell) varies from 2,000 to 5,000 gp. The more costly items can transport the subject from one plane of existence to another, if the DM allows.

The body of water must be at least 1 mile in width, so in most circumstances the  tsunami can only be summoned from the sea, large lakes, or extremely big rivers. The  wave is 2 feet high and 10 feet long for each level of experience of the caster, so a  15th-level priest would summon a tsunami 30 feet high and 150 feet wide. The wave can  appear anywhere within the spell’s range and immediately sweeps forward in the  direction specified by the caster. This may take it out of the allowed range or even back at  the casting priest. The tsunami moves at a rate of 24 (240 yards per round) and lasts one  round at 14th level, two rounds at 18th level, or three rounds at 22nd or higher level.    Ships caught by the tsunami must make a seaworthiness check (see Table 77:  Ship Types in the DMG) with a penalty equal to the wave’s height in feet. For example, a  tsunami created by a 15th-level caster would inflict a –30% penalty to a vessel’s  seaworthiness check. If the check is failed, the vessel capsizes and sinks in 1d10 rounds,  with the possible loss of those aboard. Human or humanoid swimmers caught in the wave  must make a saving throw vs. death magic or be drowned in the wave; any creature in the  water in the wave’s path will be carried along as long as it lasts.    If the priest sent the wave towards the shore, the tsunami loses 5 feet of height for  every 20 yards it travels; a 30-foot wave could wash 120 yards inland before there was  nothing left of it. Creatures caught in the area sustain 1d4 points of damage for every 5  feet of height the tsunami currently possesses and are carried along until it ends.  Air-breathing creatures must make saving throws vs. death magic or be drowned outright  by this treatment. Wooden buildings have a chance equal to three times the wave’s  current height of being destroyed by the tsunami (90% for a 30-foot wave, for example)  while stone buildings have a chance equal to the wave’s height (or 30% for a 30-foot  wave). Topography may influence or channel the wave’s advance, so a good-sized hill  could stop a tsunami cold, although its seaward face may be denuded of creatures and  vegetation by the wave.    Note that this spell in the hands of a high-level character can blanket an awesome  amount of territory and literally destroy or drown anything in its path. The tsunami is so  strenuous a spell that the priest is exhausted and helpless for 1d6 hours after summoning  it."

The breath is of a magical nature rather than a physical nature; therefore, it is unaffected by prevailing winds.   The breeze blows through the community, instantly eliminating the specified disease from all afflicted citizens. The breath of life spell does not destroy parasitic monsters (such as green slime, rot grubs, and others), nor does it cure lycanthropy or other magical afflictions. The spell does not prevent recurrence of a disease if the recipients are again exposed.   The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a cone of incense that has been blessed by the highest priest of the character's religion.   The breath of death, which produces a foul-smelling wind, is the reverse of this spell. Victims who fail a saving throw vs. death magic are afflicted with a nonmagical, fatal disease. To determine the results of this spell, the DM should roll saving throws for major NPCs in the area of effect. The effect on the rest of the community can be calculated as a percentage, based on the saving throw.   Infected creatures do not heal hit points until the disease is cured. The disease is fatal within 1d6 weeks (the duration varies from person to person).   The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dust taken from a mummy's corpse. "

The caster can cause the hovering road to rise over a jungle or cross a chasm.   The road has AC 0. It is impervious to non-magical weapons. If the road suffers 100 points of damage (from magical weapons or other magical forces), it dissipates in a black mist; all those on the road fall to the ground below.   Unless the road is destroyed, the entire hovering road remains intact from beginning to end for the duration of the spell, even if the caster is killed or incapacitated. At the end of the spell's duration, the entire road dissipates.   The material components are a chunk of black marble and a loop of gold wire. "

    "description": "   The ritual required to cast this spell is time-consuming and extremely complex. As its name implies, illusory fortification creates an illusion of a wall of heavy stonework up to 30 feet tall and 160 yards long, topped with crenellations. The illusory wall can be of any color and apparent age, potentially allowing the caster to match the false wall with the real walls of an existing castle. The illusory wall must be continuous (it cannot form two or more shorter walls), but it can follow any corners or bends that the caster desires.   In addition to the wall, the spell creates the illusion of constant movement among the crenellations, as if defending troops were moving atop the wall. The formation of the crenellations makes it impossible for a distant observer to determine exactly how many and what types of defenders are present on the illusory fortification.   The illusory wall remains in existence for 2d12 hours unless the spell is terminated earlier.   The spell has one very significant limitation: it is strictly two-dimensional and is visible from only one side (the side that the caster deems to be the \"outside\"). When viewed from the outside, the wall appears real; when viewed from the end, from above, or from the \"inside,\" the wall is totally invisible except for a faint outline of the shape of the wall. This means that friendly troops, concealed from enemy view by the illusory wall, can see their opponents clearly. The wall is most effective if friendly troops are informed of the wall's presence and are careful not to walk through the illusion. Such an occurrence does not end the spell, but it will probably advise the enemy of the nature of the wall.   Spells cast at the wall and shots fired at the illusory fortification by siege engines appear to strike the wall and inflict normal damage. In reality, the missiles or spells pass through the illusion, possibly striking troops or real fortifications beyond. Such \"hits\" do not disturb the illusion.   As soon as an enemy unit moves within 10 yards of the illusory fortification, the spell terminates and the wall vanishes.   There are two ways in which the spell can be terminated before it expires. First, the priest can terminate the spell at any time. Second, if a friendly unit makes an attack, whether melee or missile combat, through the illusory wall from the \"inside\" to the \"outside,\" the spell terminates instantly.   Once the illusory fortification has been created, the priest does not need to concentrate on the wall. The spell remains in effect even if the casting priest is killed in the interim.   The material components are the priest's holy symbol, a handful of stones, powdered mortar, and a gem worth at least 3,000 gp. All components except the holy symbol are consumed in the casting. "

    "description": " The mind tracker is a magically-created creature which exists only on the Ethereal plane. It is called into existence when the first portion of this spell is cast.   When seen (which is seldom), the mind tracker has an indistinct body. It seems to be a near-solid coalescence of the vaporous atmosphere of the Ethereal plane itself. It is a roughly elliptical body with three or more limbs protruding at seemingly random locations. The number and size of these appendages shifts slowly, however, as new ones appear from the mist and old ones disappear. The body of the creature averages 2 feet across and 3 feet long, though this, too, tends to vary from minute to minute. The mind tracker has no discernible eyes, ears, nose, or other organs. It cannot be engaged in combat; if attacked, it simply disappears, to reappear after the danger has passed, or somewhere else entirely if its quarry has moved on.    The ceremony which creates the mind tracker takes one turn to perform. Its material components are a whiff of the Ethereal plane's atmosphere and the brain of a lizard.   Once the tracker is manifested, it must be assigned a quarry within one hour. If no quarry is designated, the tracker dissipates and the spell is wasted.   To assign a quarry to the tracker, the priest must have the quarry within his sight. This includes magical sight such as true seeing, but not remote sighting devices such as crystal balls. With the quarry in sight, the priest mouths the final phrases of the spell. From that point on, the mind tracker is mentally tethered to the victim. It follows its quarry (staying always in the Ethereal plane) wherever it goes. It constantly relays information about the subject to the priest: what it is doing, where it is. The priest does not actually see an image of the quarry, he receives `reports' from the mind tracker. These reports contain only such information as the tracker can gather by looking. It cannot identify people the quarry is talking to, but can describe them in great detail. Nor can it hear anything the quarry or anyone else says, or read writing, but it recognizes and can report the fact that speaking or reading is happening.    While the tracker is dogging its quarry, its presence can be felt as an eery, creepy sensation of being watched. If the victim makes an initial save vs. paralyzation, each of the following stages lasts three hours instead of two. For the first two hours, the quarry has a general feeling of ill ease. In the third and fourth hours, the victim is distracted and nervous, and suffers a -1 penalty on all saving throws. In the fifth and sixth hours, the victim is convinced someone or something is following him and suffers a -3 penalty on saving throws and a -2 (or -10%) penalty on all other dice rolls. After six hours the victim is near his breaking point. He is unable to concentrate to cast spells or use any of his class's special abilities. All die rolls have a -5 (or -25%) penalty. After eight hours, he must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. If he fails, he collapses, fevered and delirious. This state persists until the tracker ceases to exist.    The mind tracker continues to exist for as long as the priest remains conscious of its input. If the priest is knocked out or falls asleep, or simply dismisses his creation, the tracker dissipates.    "

Like the creatures created by the spell shadow monsters, these illusory engines have at least a tenuous reality and can inflict damage on enemies.   Shadow engines are accompanied by illusory crews of the appropriate number and race. The engines can move at a rate of 20 yards per turn and are unaffected by terrain considerations. (The caster can choose to slow them when passing through rough terrain to aid the illusion of reality.)    Shadow engines cannot carry real troops. They can be fired at the same rate as real engines of the appropriate type, but a hit causes only one-half the damage normal for that type of engine (round fractions down).   A shadow engine remains in existence until the spell duration expires, until an enemy unit approaches within 10 yards, or until it suffers damage from an enemy missile attack. When any of these conditions occur, the engine vanishes. If a single spell has created multiple engines, only the engine struck vanishes; the others remain.   The crew associated with a shadow engine must remain with that engine; it cannot move more than 5 yards away from the engine itself.   Shadow engines can move independently of other engines created by the spell as long as they remain within the area of effect and remain within 240 yards of the caster. The caster must maintain concentration to control the shadow engines. He cannot cast any other spells, and he is limited to a movement rate of 6. If the caster is struck for damage, the shadow engines vanish.   The material component is a finely detailed miniature model of a siege engine (of any type), which is consumed during the casting.  "

    "description": "50-foot-diameter sphere Saving Throw: None    According to one view of the universe, what we perceive as gravity is actually a localized warping of the fabric of space-time. The spacewarp spell creates a temporary but very intense warping in a limited area.   When the priest casts this spell, he selects a specific point to be the center of effect. This point may be anywhere within 50 yards of the caster, including in midair.   When the spell is completed, this center of effect gains a gravity field equal to the force felt at the surface of the earth. In other words, gravity is centered at this point; everything within 50 feet of this center that is not attached to something immovable will fall toward the selected point.   This localized gravity affects only loose objects and creatures capable of movement (i.e., not trees, whose roots are buried in the ground). It does not affect the ground itself- soil, plants, desert sand, lake water, etc. are immune to the effect.   An object falling toward the center of gravity gains speed exactly as it would if it were falling toward the ground. When the object reaches the center, it instantly ceases its movement. If objects are already at the center, newly arriving objects will slam into them, causing normal falling damage (1d6 per 10 feet) to the newly arriving objects. Objects previously at the center must save vs. paralyzation or suffer half that amount of damage.   Consider the following example. An orc is 10 feet away from the center of effect when the spell is cast. He falls 10 feet to the center and stops. His companion, a bandit, is 30 feet from the center. It takes him longer to fall to the center, so the orc is already there when he arrives, and the two characters collide forcefully. The bandit suffers 3d6 hit points of damage--the falling damage associated with a 30-foot fall. The orc must save vs. paralyzation or suffer half that amount.   Other things are caught in the effect as well. The bandit's horse was 50 feet away from the center of effect, so it arrives at the center after the orc and the bandit. It falls 50 feet, suffering 5d6 points of damage, and potentially inflicting half that amount on both the orc and the bandit.   The center of effect can be anywhere within 50 yards of the priest. Possibly one of the most destructive uses of this spell is to cast it directly on an enemy creature. Everyone and everything within 50 feet of that creature falls toward him and strikes him, inflicting damage.   When the spell terminates, gravity returns to normal. If the spell has lifted any characters or objects off the ground, they immediately fall back to the ground, suffering the appropriate amount of falling damage.   The material components are a lodestone and a sphere of obsidian, both of which are consumed in the casting. "

    "description": "The casters Saving Throw: None    This cooperative spell is rarely used or spoken of, since its requirements are strict and the outcome is uncertain. The spell must be cast by six priests of the same faith. All six must touch hands at the time of casting. At the completion of the spell, the priests fall into a trance. The life essences of the priests leave their bodies and merge at a point within 10 feet of the casters. The spirits of the priests meld together to form the avatar of the priests' deity.   In this manner, the six characters become a single being with all the powers and abilities allowed to that avatar. The only stipulation is that the priests' deity cannot have created all avatars allowed to it at that moment. If this has happened, the spell fails and the priests are drained as described below.   If the spell succeeds, the priests have completely given their wills over to their deity, essentially forming the vessel into which it funnels power. In becoming the avatar, the priests retain the ability to make most of their own decisions. (The six must work in harmony or allow one of their number to decide all actions.) However, the deity can assume direct control of the avatar at any time it desires--the avatar is, after all, an earthly manifestation of the deity.   Although the spell has a duration of one hour, the deity is not obliged to release the priests at that time. If the priests are not released at the end of the spell's duration, they instantly die. A deity can choose to sacrifice its priests in order to maintain its avatar on the Prime Material plane. Such a cruel and unjust action is almost never undertaken by good deities or those that have any respect for life, free will, or mercy. For dark and sinister gods, the question is much more uncertain. If a deity chooses to maintain the avatar longer than one hour, control of the avatar instantly and permanently passes to the DM. (Clearly, a DM should seldom if ever exercise this power.)   While the priests are formed into the avatar, their bodies remain in a death like trance. The priests have no idea what might be happening to their real bodies (unless the avatar can observe them). Any damage to a priest's body requires an instant system shock roll. If successful, the damage is recorded normally, but the damage does not take effect until the spell ends (at which point the priest will almost certainly die). If the system shock roll is failed, the character instantly dies and the spell ends. Characters who die in this manner cannot be raised, resurrected, or reincarnated. They have been taken to the ultimate reward (or punishment) for the service they have rendered. If the bodies are moved from their positions, the spell ends.   Even if the deity releases the priests, they are left severely drained. All spells memorized are lost until the priest can rest and perform his prayers once again. The physical drain leaves each priest with only 1 hit point upon awakening, regardless of the number of hit points the character had when the spell was cast. Since damage suffered during the spell takes effect instantly, any priest who is hurt dies immediately (although quick action by others might save him).   Each priest who survives the spell will be bound by a quest (a duty that must be completed in exchange for calling upon their god).   The material component is an offering appropriate to the deity. The DM determines the exact nature of this offering.  "

When the spell is activated, six black, leathery tentacles sprout inside the room; the tentacles are evenly divided among the room's surfaces (for instance, if the room is a cube, one tentacle sprouts from the floor, one sprouts from the ceiling, and one sprouts from each of the four walls).   The whip-like tentacles grow to the length of the room and swing wildly. Each round, a tentacle has a 30% chance of striking a random creature in the room, inflicting 1d6 points of damage (save vs. spell for half damage). Each tentacle has AC 0 and 25 hit points. When a tentacle is reduced to 0 hit points, it disappears in a puff of black smoke.   If all creatures are killed or withdraw from the room, the surviving tentacles withdraw, disappearing into the walls. If the spell is activated again, six tentacles reappear; new tentacles are created to replace any destroyed previously. As long as one tentacle survives an encounter, the tentacles will continue to be replaced. Only when all six tentacles are destroyed is the spell permanently negated.

All signs of life stop and the subject is incapable of any movement or thought.

Weapons simply bounce off the subject as they would bounce off the hardest stone. Spells, including dispel magic, are totally incapable of affecting the subject in any way. The subject does not age.   Aside from the fact that the subject remains visible, frozen in place like a statue, he is effectively no longer part of the universe. (DMs may rule that the most powerful of magics, such as wishes, and creatures of demigod or higher status can affect the subject.)   When the priest casts the spell, he or she states the duration for which the spell will remain in effect (the maximum is one full day per level of the caster). Once the spell is cast, this duration cannot be changed; the priest cannot terminate the spell before the stated time has elapsed.   If the subject is unwilling to be affected by the spell, the priest must touch the victim for the spell to take effect; the subject receives a normal saving throw to resist the effects. A willing subject need not make a saving throw.   The priest may cast this spell on himself if desired. This spell can provide a powerful defensive maneuver; while the spell is in effect, the subject is totally invulnerable. Timelessness is also an effective form of long-term imprisonment, as long as the priest is around to cast the spell again at the appropriate time.   This is an exceptionally powerful spell. Casting it puts a significant strain on the priest. Each time he casts timelessness, the priest must make a system shock roll. If the priest fails this throw, he or she permanently loses 1 point of Constitution. The material components are a gem worth at least 1,000 gp and a small cylinder of obsidian. Both are crushed during the casting. "

Torrential Rain/Blizzard: Visibility is reduced to 100 yards or less; travel is nearly impossible due to water or heavy snow on the ground.

A death pact is triggered whenever the protected individual is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points (mortally wounded) due to combat, spell, or accident. In the same round, the subject receives the following benefits: l The individual (or his or her remains) and all possessions are transported immediately back to a religious sanctuary as if by a word of recall (the location of the sanctuary must be specified at the time of forging the death pact). l Upon arrival, the individual receives a raise dead spell (if necessary) and automatically makes any required system shock roll. l Any physical damage sustained by the individual is completely healed except for 2-5 (ld4+l) points of damage.l Any severed or amputated limbs are instantaneously regenerated. l The body is cleared of lingering enchantments with a dispel magic (bestowed at caster's level), whether beneficial or baneful, and cleansed of all poisons, diseases, blindness, curses, and insanity. A death pact will remain in effect indefinitely until the conditions established at the time of its forging have been fulfilled. The pact may be established to benefit an individual other than the caster. However, in almost all cases, the chosen one must be in good standing with the caster's religion and agree to undertake a mission that will directly benefit the deity or dark power responsible for granting the spell. A dispel magic cannot end a death pact prematurely. This powerful spell is not without its costs, however. Forging a death pact is an exhaustively stressful process, drawing the priest into draining audiences with extraplanar powers. As a result, establishing a death pact ages the caster five years and requires at least one week for complete recuperation, during which time the priest cannot cast any spells or engage in any physically demanding activity. Furthermore, when the pact is invoked, the mystical transport and instantaneous healing exacts another toll, this time aging the recipient for five years (if the individual was raised, he or she also loses one point of Constitution permanently). Thus, if the priest casts the spell on him- or herself, he or she must be prepared to sacrifice at least ten years of life! The spell's material components are an (un)holy sanctuary consecrated to the caster's deity and seven drops each of the caster's blood, the recipient's blood, (un)holy water, and dew. This powerful pact has enabled many \"slain\" priests to return from the dead and eliminate their enemies. Wicked necromancers in the service of evil deities are rumored to have significantly reduced the terrible personal toll on the caster by some unspeakably foul sacrifice. Note that powerful wizard necromancers might achieve a similar effect with wish-fortified contingency spells."
